A double blind study of the antidepressants dibenzepin (Noveril) and amitriptyline.,Apr 1976,"The study undertook to compare the efficacy of dibenzepin and amitriptyline in the treatment of endogenous depression. The outcome of the study was that both drugs appear to be equally effective in the treatment of depression, but dibenzepin was more efficient in reducing associated anxiety. Both drugs are appropriate to the treatment of psychotic depression, and work equally rapid. There was also a tendency for dibenzepin to elicit less intense side effects.","Baron, D P; Unger, H R; Williams, H E; Knight, R G",The New Zealand medical journal,0028-8446,,8749,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8749,
