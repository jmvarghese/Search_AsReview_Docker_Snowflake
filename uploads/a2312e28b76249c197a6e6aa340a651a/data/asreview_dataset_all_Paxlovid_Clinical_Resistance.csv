10,Systematic analyses of the resistance potential of drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease,,"Drugs that target the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 are effective therapeutics that have entered clinical use. Wide-scale use of these drugs will apply selection pressure for the evolution of resistance mutations. To understand resistance potential in Mpro, we performed comprehensive surveys of amino acid changes that can cause resistance in a yeast screen to nirmatrelvir (contained in the drug Paxlovid), and ensitrelvir (Xocova) that is currently in phase III trials. The most impactful resistance mutation (E166V) recently reported in multiple viral passaging studies with nirmatrelvir showed the strongest drug resistance score for nirmatrelvir, while P168R had the strongest resistance score for ensitrelvir. Using a systematic approach to assess potential drug resistance, we identified 142 resistance mutations for nirmatrelvir and 177 for ensitrelvir. Among these mutations, 99 caused apparent resistance to both inhibitors, suggesting a strong likelihood for the evolution of cross-resistance. Many mutations that exhibited inhibitor-specific resistance were consistent with distinct ways that each inhibitor protrudes beyond the substrate envelope. In addition, mutations with strong drug resistance scores tended to have reduced function. Our results indicate that strong pressure from nirmatrelvir or ensitrelvir will select for multiple distinct resistant lineages that will include both primary resistance mutations that weaken interactions with drug while decreasing enzyme function and secondary mutations that increase enzyme activity. The comprehensive identification of resistance mutations enables the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of developing resistance and aids in the surveillance of drug resistance in circulating viral populations.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

185,Contributions of Hyperactive Mutations in Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 to Drug Resistance.,2024 04 12,"The appearance and spread of mutations that cause drug resistance in rapidly evolving diseases, including infections by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are major concerns for human health. Many drugs target enzymes, and resistance-conferring mutations impact inhibitor binding or enzyme activity. Nirmatrelvir, the most widely used inhibitor currently used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, targets the main protease (Mpro) preventing it from processing the viral polyprotein into active subunits. Our previous work systematically analyzed resistance mutations in Mpro that reduce binding to inhibitors; here, we investigate mutations that affect enzyme function. Hyperactive mutations that increase Mpro activity can contribute to drug resistance but have not been thoroughly studied. To explore how hyperactive mutations contribute to resistance, we comprehensively assessed how all possible individual mutations in Mpro affect enzyme function using a mutational scanning approach with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based yeast readout. We identified hundreds of mutations that significantly increased the Mpro activity. Hyperactive mutations occurred both proximal and distal to the active site, consistent with protein stability and/or dynamics impacting activity. Hyperactive mutations were observed 3 times more than mutations which reduced apparent binding to nirmatrelvir in recent studies of laboratory-grown viruses selected for drug resistance. Hyperactive mutations were also about three times more prevalent than nirmatrelvir binding mutations in sequenced isolates from circulating SARS-CoV-2. Our findings indicate that hyperactive mutations are likely to contribute to the natural evolution of drug resistance in Mpro and provide a comprehensive list for future surveillance efforts.",Flynn JM; Zvornicanin SN; Tsepal T; Shaqra AM; Kurt Yilmaz N; Jia W; Moquin S; Dovala D; Schiffer CA; Bolon DNA,,,/10.1021/acsinfecdis.3c00560,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1021%2facsinfecdis.3c00560,1,0,,8
233,Multiple pathways for SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir.,2022 Aug 18,"Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in reducing hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 1,2 . However, as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities 3a""9 , there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here, we have examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in increasing concentrations of nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale in 480 wells. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both, and their sequences revealed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment done at a larger scale with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Yet, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L, or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones, each containing a unique mutation or a combination of mutations showed that the above precursor mutations only mediated low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (~100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Structural explanations are discussed for some of the mutations that are proximal to the drug-binding site, as well as cross-resistance or lack thereof to ensitrelvir, another clinically important 3CL protease inhibitor. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro , and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next generation protease inhibitors.",Iketani S; Mohri H; Culbertson B; Hong SJ; Duan Y; Luck MI; Annavajhala MK; Guo Y; Sheng Z; Uhlemann AC; Goff SP; Sabo Y; Yang H; Chavez A; Ho DD,,,/10.1101/2022.08.07.499047,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm7&DO=10.1101%2f2022.08.07.499047,1,0,,9
179,Nirmatrelvir Resistance in an Immunocompromised Patient with Persistent Coronavirus Disease 2019.,2024 04 30,"Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is coming to an end, it still poses a threat to the immunocompromised and others with underlying diseases. Especially in cases of persistent COVID-19, new mutations conferring resistance to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) therapies have considerable clinical implications. We present a patient who independently acquired a T21I mutation in the 3CL protease after nirmatrelvir exposure. The T21I mutation in the 3CL protease is one of the most frequent mutations responsible for nirmatrelvir resistance. However, limited reports exist on actual cases of SARS-CoV-2 with T21I and other mutations in the 3CL protease. The patient, a 55 year-old male, had COVID-19 during chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. He was treated with nirmatrelvir early in the course of the disease but relapsed, and SARS-CoV-2 with a T21I mutation in the 3CL protease was detected in nasopharyngeal swab fluid. The patient had temporary respiratory failure but later recovered well. During treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone, viruses with the T21I mutation in the 3CL protease showed a decreasing trend during disease progression while increasing during improvement. The impact of drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 on the clinical course, including its severity, remains unknown. Our study is important for examining the clinical impact of nirmatrelvir resistance in COVID-19.",Yamamoto C; Taniguchi M; Furukawa K; Inaba T; Niiyama Y; Ide D; Mizutani S; Kuroda J; Tanino Y; Nishioka K; Watanabe Y; Takayama K; Nakaya T; Nukui Y,,,/10.3390/v16050718,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.3390%2fv16050718,1,0,,11
195,Resistance-associated mutations to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent nirmatrelvir: Selection not induction.,2024 Feb,"Mutations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resistance to antiprotease nirmatrelvir were reported. We aimed to detect them in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and quasispecies retrieved in our institute before drug availability in January 2022 and to analyze the impact of mutations on protease (3CLpro) structure. We sought for 38 3CLpro nirmatrelvir resistance mutations in a set of 62 673 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained in our institute from respiratory samples collected between 2020 and 2023 and for these mutations in SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies for 90 samples collected in 2020, using Python. SARS-CoV-2 protease with major mutation E166V was generated with Swiss Pdb Viewer and Molegro Molecular Viewer. We detected 22 (58%) of the resistance-associated mutations in 417 (0.67%) of the genomes analyzed; 325 (78%) of these genomes had been obtained from samples collected in 2020-2021. APOBEC signatures were found for 12/22 mutations. We also detected among viral quasispecies from 90 samples some minority reads harboring any of 15 nirmatrelvir resistance mutations, including E166V. Also, we predicted that E166V has a very limited effect on 3CLpro structure but may prevent drug attachment. Thus, we evidenced that mutations associated with nirmatrelvir resistance pre-existed in SARS-CoV-2 before drug availability. These findings further warrant SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies characterization. Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors.

274,Evolutionary and Structural Insights about Potential SARS-CoV-2 Evasion of Nirmatrelvir.,2022 07 14,"The U.S. FDA approval of PAXLOVID, a combination therapy of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir has significantly boosted our morale in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Nirmatrelvir is an inhibitor of the main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2. Since many SARS-CoV-2 variants that resist vaccines and antibodies have emerged, a concern of acquired viral resistance to nirmatrelvir naturally arises. Here, possible mutations in MPro to confer viral evasion of nirmatrelvir are analyzed and discussed from both evolutionary and structural standpoints. The analysis indicates that those mutations will likely reside in the whole aa45-51 helical region and residues including M165, L167, P168, R188, and Q189. Relevant mutations have also been observed in existing SARS-CoV-2 samples. Implications of this analysis to the fight against future drug-resistant viral variants and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals are discussed as well.",Yang KS; Leeuwon SZ; Xu S; Liu WR,,,/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00404,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.1021%2facs.jmedchem.2c00404,1,0,,14
44,495. De novo emergence of resistance mutations during treatment of SARSCoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients,,"Background. Vaccination and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 are constantly hindered by the rapid emergence of new viral variants less sensitive to antibodies or antivirals. Emerging evidence points to prolonged replication in the immunocompromised host as a key factor contributing to emergence of viral genomic mutations. We analyzed viral evolution and emergence of intra-host variants in response to treatments including antivirals and monoclonal antibodies in immunocompromised subjects with hematological malignancies infected with SARS-CoV2. Methods. From April 2020 to August 2022, we collected 245 nasopharyngeal samples from 92 patients including longitudinal samples of 31 subjects with persistent infection (detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA >=30 days regardless of symptomatology). The number of samples per subject ranged from 1-14. To identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations, we performed whole genome sequencing using an amplicon-based approach and the Illumina NextSeq platform. Only samples that had 75% genome covered at 5x read depth were included in the analysis. Results. After quality control filtering, 21 subjects had at least 2 samples available for longitudinal analyses. Ten of them had no consensus changes during infection (compared to the first sample collected), and 11 had at least 1 change. The spike protein was the most likely location for a consensus change (9 patients), followed by consensus changes in nsp3, nsp12, nsp13, N, ORF8, and nsp4. Mutations tended to appear mostly following treatment, with an increased number of changes apparently associated with worse outcome. After treatment, 3 patients developed mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) that are known to be associated with remdesivir resistance. One Paxlovid treated patient developed a nsp5 protease mutation potentially associated with resistance. Another patient developed a spike mutation associated with resistance to sotrovimab. Conclusion. Our results underscore the need for augmented efforts to study intra-host evolution in the immunocompromised host, identify and isolate viruses resistant to treatment(s) and identify host determinants associated with accelerated resistance. These results are important for implementing optimal treatment strategies and to inform infection control measures.",Johnson K.; Soave R.; Wang W.; Albert J.; Kodiyanplakkal R.P.; Salpietro M.; Jing-Mei H.; Diel D.G.; Ghedin E.; Salvatore M.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.564,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofad500.564,1,0,,15
18,Structural basis of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir resistance profiles against SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease naturally occurring polymorphisms,,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Mpro is the main viral protease, with a critical role in replication and, therefore, an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. The clinically approved drug nirmatrelvir from Pfizer, and the clinical candidate ensitrelvir from Shionogi Pharmaceuticals had so far showed great potential for treatment of viral infections. Despite the importance of new therapeutics, the broad use of antivirals is often associated with mutation selection and resistance generation. Herein, we characterized 14 naturally occurring polymorphisms that are already in circulation and are within the radius of action of these two antivirals. Nirmatrelvir retained most of its in vitro activity against most polymorphism tested, while mutants G143S and Q189K were associated with higher resistance. For ensitrelvir, higher resistance was observed for polymorphisms M49I, G143S and R188S, but not for Q189K, suggesting a distinct resistance profile difference between the two inhibitors. The crystal structures of selected polymorphism reveal the structural basis for resistance generation. Our data will assist the monitoring of potential resistant strains, support the design of combined therapy to avoid resistance, as well as assist the development of a next generation of Mpro inhibitors.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In the present-day scenario, conditions of Tuberculosis patients have worsened due to COVID-19 with escalated mortality rates.

89,Persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR Positivity Despite Anti-viral Treatment in Immunodeficient Patients,,"Purpose: COVID-19 infection in immunodeficient individuals can result in chronically poor health, persistent or relapsing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, and long-term infectious potential. While clinical trials have demonstrated promising outcomes using anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicines in immunocompetent hosts, their ability to achieve sustained viral clearance in immunodeficient patients remains unknown. We therefore aimed to study long-term virological outcomes in patients treated at our centre. Method(s): We followed up immunocompromised inpatients treated with casirivimab-imdevimab (Ronapreve) between September and December 2021, and immunocompromised patients who received sotrovimab, molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), or no treatment from December 2021 to March 2022. Nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples were obtained either in hospital or in the community until sustained viral clearance, defined as 3 consecutive negative PCR samples, was achieved. Positive samples were sequenced and analysed for mutations of interest. Result(s): We observed sustained viral clearance in 71 of 103 patients, none of whom died. Of the 32/103 patients where sustained clearance was not confirmed, 6 died (between 2 and 34 days from treatment). Notably, we observed 25 cases of sputum positivity despite negative nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity following a negative sample in 12 cases. Patients were then divided into those who cleared within 28 days and those with PCR positivity beyond 28 days. We noted lower B cell counts in the group with persistent PCR positivity (mean (SD) 0.06 (0.10) x109/L vs 0.22 (0.28) x109/L, p = 0.015) as well as lower IgA (median (IQR) 0.00 (0.00-0.15) g/L vs 0.40 (0.00-0.95) g/L, p = 0.001) and IgM (median (IQR) 0.05 (0.00-0.28) g/L vs 0.35 (0.10-1.10) g/L, p = 0.005). No differences were seen in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell counts. Antiviral treatment did not impact risk of persistent PCR positivity. Conclusion(s): Persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity is common among immunodeficient individuals, especially those with antibody deficiencies, regardless of anti-viral treatment. Peripheral B cell count and serum IgA and IgM levels are predictors of viral persistence.Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s).",Chan M.; Linn M.M.N.; O'Hagan T.; Guerra-Assuncao J.A.; Lackenby A.; Workman S.; Dacre A.; Burns S.O.; Breuer J.; Hart J.; Tadros S.; Lowe D.M.,,0271-9142,/10.1007/s10875-023-01504-9,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1007%2fs10875-023-01504-9,,,,19
182,An orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor exhibits improved affinity and reduced sensitivity to mutations.,2024 Mar 13,"Inhibitors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) such as nirmatrelvir (NTV) and ensitrelvir (ETV) have proven effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but the presence of resistance-conferring mutations in sequenced viral genomes raises concerns about future drug resistance. Second-generation oral drugs that retain function against these mutants are thus urgently needed. We hypothesized that the covalent hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor boceprevir (BPV) could serve as the basis for orally bioavailable drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro more efficiently than existing drugs. Performing structure-guided modifications of BPV, we developed a picomolar-affinity inhibitor, ML2006a4, with antiviral activity, oral pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy similar or superior to those of NTV. A crucial feature of ML2006a4 is a derivatization of the ketoamide reactive group that improves cell permeability and oral bioavailability. Last, ML2006a4 was found to be less sensitive to several mutations that cause resistance to NTV or ETV and occur in the natural SARS-CoV-2 population. Thus, anticipatory design can preemptively address potential resistance mechanisms to expand future treatment options against coronavirus variants.",Westberg M; Su Y; Zou X; Huang P; Rustagi A; Garhyan J; Patel PB; Fernandez D; Wu Y; Hao C; Lo CW; Karim M; Ning L; Beck A; Saenkham-Huntsinger P; Tat V; Drelich A; Peng BH; Einav S; Tseng CK; Blish C; Lin MZ,,,/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi0979,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1126%2fscitranslmed.adi0979,,,,20
45,Resistance mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to the non-covalent inhibitor WU-04,,"Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we identified two double mutations, M49K/M165V and M49K/S301P, in the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) that confer resistance to a novel non-covalent inhibitor, WU-04, which is currently in phase III clinical trials (NCT06197217). Crystallographic analysis indicates that the M49K mutation destabilizes the WU-04-binding pocket, impacting the binding of WU-04 more significantly than the binding of 3CLpro substrates. The M165V mutation directly interferes with WU-04 binding. The S301P mutation, which is far from the WU-04-binding pocket, indirectly affects WU-04 binding by restricting the rotation of 3CLpro's C-terminal tail and impeding 3CLpro dimerization. We further explored 3CLpro mutations that confer resistance to two clinically used inhibitors: ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir, and revealed a trade-off between the catalytic activity, thermostability, and drug resistance of 3CLpro. We found that mutations at the same residue (M49) can have distinct effects on the 3CLpro inhibitors, highlighting the importance of developing multiple antiviral agents with different skeletons for fighting SARS-CoV-2. These findings enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 resistance mechanisms and inform the development of effective therapeutics.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2024.",Zhang L.; Xie X.; Luo H.; Qian R.; Yang Y.; Yu H.; Huang J.; Shi P.-Y.; Hu Q.,,2056-5968,/10.1038/s41421-024-00673-0,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1038%2fs41421-024-00673-0,,,,21
181,Computational Insights into SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Mutations and Nirmatrelvir Efficacy: The Effects of P132H and P132H-A173V.,2024 Jul 08,"Nirmatrelvir, a pivotal component of the oral antiviral Paxlovid for COVID-19, targets the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) as a covalent inhibitor. Here, we employed combined computational methods to explore how the prevalent Omicron variant mutation P132H, alone and in combination with A173V (P132H-A173V), affects nirmatrelvir's efficacy. Our findings suggest that P132H enhances the noncovalent binding affinity of Mpro for nirmatrelvir, whereas P132H-A173V diminishes it. Although both mutants catalyze the rate-limiting step more efficiently than the wild-type (WT) Mpro, P132H slows the overall rate of covalent bond formation, whereas P132H-A173V accelerates it. Comprehensive analysis of noncovalent and covalent contributions to the overall binding free energy of the covalent complex suggests that P132H likely enhances Mpro sensitivity to nirmatrelvir, while P132H-A173V may confer resistance. Per-residue decompositions of the binding and activation free energies pinpoint key residues that significantly affect the binding affinity and reaction rates, revealing how the mutations modulate these effects.

41,Antiviral and Monoclonal Antibody Combination Therapy in Haematological Patients in the Omicron Era,,"Immunocompromised (IC) patients are at higher risk for persistent and/or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by different viral variants, with a high case-fatality ratio.1,2 The first persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection (5 months) was reported in 2020 in an IC patient with a long persistence of SARS-CoV-2,3 immediately followed by further reports.2,4 Indeed, the impairment of the immune system changes the natural history of COVID-19. However, no consensus exists on clinical management of IC COVID-19 patients.5 Several reports emphasize the clinical relevance of a combination therapy between small-molecule antivirals (AV) and anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) both in early and prolonged COVID-19 clinical management.6,7 In 2022, tixagevimab/cilgavimab (T/C) MoAb fixed combination was introduced as early therapy for outpatient with COVID-19.8 We describe here a single-center case series of 22 IC COVID-19 in patients with hematological disorders (HD) treated with a combined therapy based on tixagevimab/cilgavimab (T/C) plus small-molecule antivirals (AV), between April 1, 2022, and November 30, 2022.Copyright Â© 2024 Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

165,H172Y mutation perturbs the S1 pocket and nirmatrelvir binding of SARS-CoV-2 main protease through a nonnative hydrogen bond.,2022 Aug 09,"Nirmatrelvir is an orally available inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the main ingredient of PAXLOVID, a drug approved by FDA for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Although the prevalent Mpro mutants in the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (e.g., Omicron) are still susceptible to nirmatrelvir, a rare natural mutation, H172Y, was found to significantly reduce nirmatrelvir's inhibitory activity. As the selective pressure of antiviral therapy may favor resistance mutations, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of the H172Y mutation on Mpro's structure, function, and drug resistance. Here we report the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as the measurements of stability, enzyme kinetics of H172Y Mpro, and IC50 value of nirmatrelvir. Simulations showed that mutation disrupts the interactions between the S1 pocket and N terminus of the opposite protomer. Intriguingly, a native hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Phe140 and the N terminus is replaced by a transient H-bond between Phe140 and Tyr172. In the ligand-free simulations, strengthening of this nonnative H-bond is correlated with disruption of the conserved aromatic stacking between Phe140 and His163, leading to a partial collapse of the oxyanion loop. In the nirmatrelvir-bound simulations, the nonnative H-bond is correlated with the loss of an important H-bond between Glu166 and nirmatrelvir's lactam nitrogen at P1 position. These results are consistent with the newly reported X-ray structures of H172Y Mpro and suggest a mechanism by which the H172Y substitution perturbs the S1 pocket, leading to the decreased structural stability and binding affinity, which in turn explains the drastic reduction in catalytic activity and antiviral susceptibility.",de Oliveira VM; Ibrahim MF; Sun X; Hilgenfeld R; Shen J,,,/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1915291/v1,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm&DO=10.21203%2frs.3.rs-1915291%2fv1,,,,24

227,Advances and challenges in using nirmatrelvir and its derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2023 Mar,"On December 22, 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first main protease inhibitor, i.e., oral antiviral nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332)/ritonavir (Paxlovid), for the treatment of early severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Nirmatrelvir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection, but high doses or long-term treatment may cause embryonic developmental toxicity and changes in host gene expression. The chiral structure of nirmatrelvir plays a key role in its antiviral activity. Ritonavir boosts the efficacy of nirmatrelvir by inactivating cytochrome P450 3A4 expression and occupying the plasma protein binding sites. Multidrug resistance protein 1 inhibitors may increase the efficacy of nirmatrelvir. However, Paxlovid has many contraindications. Some patients treated with Paxlovid experience a second round of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms soon after recovery. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir metabolites, such as compounds 12-18, is similar to or higher than that of nirmatrelvir. Herein, we review the advances and challenges in using nirmatrelvir and its derivatives with the aim of providing knowledge for drug developers and physicians in the fight against COVID-19.

66,COVID-19 therapeutics: stewardship in England and considerations for antimicrobial resistance,,"The COVID-19 pandemic saw unprecedented resources and funds driven into research for the development, and subsequent rapid distribution, of vaccines, diagnostics and directly acting antivirals (DAAs). DAAs have undeniably prevented progression and life-threatening conditions in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, there are concerns of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), antiviral resistance specifically, for DAAs. To preserve activity of DAAs for COVID-19 therapy, as well as detect possible mutations conferring resistance, antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance were rapidly implemented in England. This paper expands on the ubiquitous ongoing public health activities carried out in England, including epidemiologic, virologic and genomic surveillance, to support the stewardship of DAAs and assess the deployment, safety, effectiveness and resistance potential of these novel and repurposed therapeutics.Copyright Â© 2023 Oxford University Press.

31,NIRMATRELVIR/RITONAVIR-INDUCED SIADH: A CASE SERIES,,"SESSION TITLE: Critical Care Case Reports Posters (BM) SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/09/2024 12:30 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Hyponatremia is not uncommon in the critical care setting (1). One of many etiologies of hyponatremia includes SIADH, which can be a result of medication effects or other physiologic imbalances. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has been used for treatment of COVID-19 in patients at risk of progression to severe disease since it gained Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA in December 2021 and can rarely cause SIADH. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man with a history of pre-diabetes and hyperlipidemia tested positive for COVID after experiencing a persistent headache. After initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, he developed vomiting, progressive lethargy, confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait, prompting him to present to the hospital. Examination revealed gait instability and mental slowing, but no focal neurological deficits. He was found to have a sodium of 103.Similarly, a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease developed cough, fever, and shortness of breath, and subsequently tested positive for COVID. After initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, these symptoms improved, but she developed nausea and vomiting followed by dizziness and confusion. Her bloodwork revealed a sodium of 108.Both patients had decreased serum osmolality, increased urine osmolality, and urine sodium over 20. This constellation of findings in euvolemic patients with normal thyroid function and no evidence of hypocortisolism led to diagnosis of SIADH. In Patient 2, thiazide diuretics may have also contributed to hyponatremia. Both patients were admitted to the ICU for monitoring and correction of severe, symptomatic hyponatremia. They underwent usual management for SIADH and discontinuation of the offending agent, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. As sodium increased, Patient 1 received urea tablets while Patient 2 was given sodium tablets. Both patients steadily improved symptomatically as their sodium levels increased. DISCUSSION: We present two cases of severe, symptomatic hyponatremia consistent with SIADH after initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. While the association between COVID-19 and hyponatremia has been well described (2-4), emerging reports of severe hyponatremia in patients on Paxlovid implicate it as another potential cause of hyponatremia (5, 6). In both cases presented here, onset of symptoms associated with hyponatremia - vomiting, confusion, dizziness - occurred after the initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, while other typical COVID symptoms resolved or were improving at time of medication initiation. Furthermore, discontinuation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and standard treatment for hyponatremia steadily improved their sodium levels. This temporal relationship supports the conclusion that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir initiated their SIADH rather than COVID itself. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is known to have many drug-drug interactions due to its effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes that may contribute to hyponatremia, but has also been associated with SIADH, as reported here (7, 8). These cases demonstrate the need for further research on the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on sodium balance given the potential for severe adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-induced SIADH is an underappreciated cause of severe hyponatremia in the ICU. Clinicians should be aware of this rare complication as use of this important medication becomes more routine. REFERENCE #1: 1. DeVita MV, Gardenswartz MH, Konecky A, Zabetakis PM.

19,Predicting antiviral resistance mutations in SARS-CoV-2 main protease with computational and experimental screening,,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral replication and has been the focus of many drug discovery efforts since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nirmatrelvir (NTV) is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that is used in the combination drug Paxlovid for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. However, with increased use of NTV across the globe, there is a possibility that future SARS-CoV-2 lineages will evolve resistance to NTV. Early prediction and monitoring of resistance mutations could allow for measures to slow the spread of resistance and for the development of new compounds with activity against resistant strains. In this work, we have used in silico mutational scanning and inhibitor docking of Mpro to identify potential resistance mutations. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed five mutations (N142L, E166M, Q189E, Q189I, and Q192T) that reduce the potency of NTV and of a previously identified non-covalent cyclic peptide inhibitor of Mpro. The E166M mutation reduced the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NTV 24-fold, and 118-fold for the non-covalent peptide inhibitor. Our findings inform the ongoing genomic surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

221,Dynamical Nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations Identify Allosteric Sites and Positions Associated with Drug Resistance in the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.,2023 Jun 26,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) plays an essential role in the coronavirus lifecycle by catalyzing hydrolysis of the viral polyproteins at specific sites. Mpro is the target of drugs, such as nirmatrelvir, though resistant mutants have emerged that threaten drug efficacy. Despite its importance, questions remain on the mechanism of how Mpro binds its substrates. Here, we apply dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to evaluate structural and dynamical responses of Mpro to the presence and absence of a substrate. The results highlight communication between the Mpro dimer subunits and identify networks, including some far from the active site, that link the active site with a known allosteric inhibition site, or which are associated with nirmatrelvir resistance. They imply that some mutations enable resistance by altering the allosteric behavior of Mpro. More generally, the results show the utility of the D-NEMD technique for identifying functionally relevant allosteric sites and networks including those relevant to resistance.

162,An Integrative Approach to Dissect the Drug Resistance Mechanism of the H172Y Mutation of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.,2023 Mar 06,"Nirmatrelvir is an orally available inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the main ingredient of PAXLOVID, a drug approved by FDA for high-risk COVID-19 patients.

217,Upgrading nirmatrelvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via DeepFrag and free energy calculations.,2023 11,"The first oral drug for the treatment of COVID-19, Paxlovid, has been authorized; however, nirmatrelvir, a major component of the drug, is reported to be associated with some side effects. Moreover, the appearance of many novel variants raises concerns about drug resistance, and designing new potent inhibitors to prevent viral replication is thus urgent. In this context, using a hybrid approach combining machine learning (ML) and free energy simulations, 6 compounds obtained by modifying nirmatrelvir were proposed to bind strongly to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The structural modification of nirmatrelvir significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction free energy between the protein and ligand and slightly decreases the vdW term. However, the vdW term is the most important factor in controlling the ligand-binding affinity. In addition, the modified nirmatrelvir might be less toxic to the human body than the original inhibitor. Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Inc.

194,Generation and evaluation of protease inhibitor-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains.,2024 02,"Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the search for antiviral therapies has been at the forefront of medical research. To date, the 3CLpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid R) has shown the best results in clinical trials and the greatest robustness against variants. A second SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor, ensitrelvir (Xocova R), has been developed. Ensitrelvir, currently in Phase 3, was approved in Japan under the emergency regulatory approval procedure in November 2022, and is available since March 31, 2023. One of the limitations for the use of antiviral monotherapies is the emergence of resistance mutations. Here, we experimentally generated mutants resistant to nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir in vitro following repeating passages of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of both antivirals. For both molecules, we demonstrated a loss of sensitivity for resistance mutants in vitro. Using a Syrian golden hamster infection model, we showed that the ensitrelvir M49L mutation, in the multi-passage strain, confers a high level of in vivo resistance. Finally, we identified a recent increase in the prevalence of M49L-carrying sequences, which appears to be associated with multiple repeated emergence events in Japan and may be related to the use of Xocova R in the country since November 2022. These results highlight the strategic importance of genetic monitoring of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains to ensure that treatments administered retain their full effectiveness.

157,Theoretical insights into the binding interaction of Nirmatrelvir with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutants (C145A and C145S): MD simulations and binding free-energy calculation to understand drug resistance.,2023 Aug 20,"Mpro, the main protease and a crucial enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 is the most fascinating molecular target for pharmacological treatment and is also liable for viral protein maturation. For antiviral therapy, no drugs have been approved clinically to date. Targeting the Mpro with a compound having inhibitory properties against it can hinder viral replication. The therapeutic potential of the antiviral compound Nirmatrelvir (NMV) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was investigated using a systematic approach of molecular docking, MD simulations, and binding free energy calculation based on the MM-GBSA method. NMV, a covalent inhibitor with a recently revealed chemical structure, is a promising oral antiviral clinical candidate with significant in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 action in third-phase clinical trials. To explore the therapeutic ability and possible drug resistance, the Mpro system was studied for WT and two of its primary mutants (C145A & C145S). The protein-ligand (Mpro/NMV) complexes were further examined through long MD simulations to check the possible drug resistance in the mutants. To understand the binding affinity, the MM-GBSA method was applied to the Mpro/NMV complexes. Moreover, PCA analysis confirms the detachment of the linker region from the major domains in C145S and C145A mutants allowing for conformational alterations in the active-site region. Based on the predicted biological activities and binding affinities of NMV to WT and mutant (C145A & C145S) Mpro, it can be stipulated that NMV may have conventional potency to act as an anti-viral agent against WT Mpro, while the catalytic-dyad mutations may show substantial mutation-induced drug resistance.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

42,361. Evaluation of Resistance to Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 (EPIC) High-Risk and Standard-Risk Clinical Trials,,"Background. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir administered twice daily for 5 days (5D) (within 5 days of symptom onset) resulted in a clinically and statistically significant (6% absolute and 86% relative) risk reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalization or all cause death throughDay 28 [1]. COVID-19 rebound regardless of treatment has been reported [2,3,4]. Here, an integrated analysis of EPIC-HR/SR [5,6] virology data was conducted to evaluate clinical resistance to nirm/r and if it is associated with viral load rebound (VLR) or progression to severe COVID-19 (i.e., hospitalization or death by D28). Methods. Next generation sequencing analysis was performed from nasal swabs (D1, D3, D5, D10 and D14) with a viral RNA level >=3.0 log10 copies/mL. The amino acid (AA) sequence was compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 [7] and Mpro substitutions were called if AAFREQ >= 10%. Emergent substitutions (ES) were called if observed postbaseline only and called treatment emergent substitutions (TES) if the ES was >= 2.5-fold more frequent, and had >=3 additional occurrences, in nirm/r than placebo (PBO). Viral RNA load rebound (VLR) was defined as VL increase at D10 or D14 by >= 0.5 log10 copies/mL from D5 and resulting in a VL >= 3.0 log10 copies/mL. Results. In EPIC-HR/SR, the primary SARS-CoV-2 variant was Delta (91%) followed by Omicron (7.4%). The percentage of patients with Mpro ES did not differ between treatment arms. Among those with sequence data available (n=898 nirm/r, n=938 PBO), nirm/r Mpro TES were observed in: T98I/del(n=3), E166V (n=3), and W207L/del (n=3) and within the Mpro cleavage sites: A5328S/V(n=5) and S6799A/ P/Y (n=4). None of the TES were associated with progression to severe COVID-19. VLR was observed in (6.1% nirm/r, 4.4% PBO) with Mpro TES observed in few VLR patients (3.4% in nirm/r and 0% in PBO). Among the Mpro TES identified, E166V is an in vitro resistance mutation [8,9]. Figure 1 shows the VL trajectories of the 3 patients with E166V, one patient experienced VLR at D10, all effectively controlled the virus by D14 and did not experience severe COVID-19. Conclusion. In EPIC-HR/SR, an in vitro resistance substitution emerged in few patients, but was not associated severe COVID-19. Additionally, these data show VLR is not a result of treatment resistance to nirm/r driven by TES or any Mpro substitutions.",Baniecki M.L.; Guan S.; Wang Z.; Chen Y.; Bao W.; He W.; Dushin E.; Hyde C.; Zhu Y.; Cardin R.D.; Hammond J.; Menon S.; Allerton C.; Soares H.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.431,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofad500.431,,,,39
231,PaxlovidTM Information From FDA and Guidance for AES Members.,2022 Jun,"This American Epilepsy Society (AES) official statement provides information and preliminary guidance to Society members related to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) December 22, 2021 Emergency Use Authorization for Paxlovid TM for the oral treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (>=12 years and weighing >=40 kg). Paxlovid is likely to be widely prescribed, and important considerations for patients on antiseizure medications (ASMs) include key contraindications and potential toxicity or dose adjustments while taking Paxlovid. This statement highlights concerns and provides information about their pharmacologic basis. Of particular concern, concomitant use of Paxlovid with the ASMs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone is contraindicated, because they are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 isozyme that metabolizes Paxlovid and thereby could cause loss of virologic response and development of resistance. Alternate oral or intravenous COVID-19 treatments should be considered. A second concern is that Paxlovid may increase the plasma concentrations of many ASMs, because it inhibits the CYP3A4 isozyme. ASMs that are metabolized, at least in part, by CYP3A4 include cannabidiol, carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, lacosamide, midazolam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, stiripentol, tiagabine, and zonisamide. Patients receiving these medications may warrant closer monitoring while being treated with Paxlovid.

70,Pre-exposure prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the Omicron BA.5 wave at a single institution in Japan,,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab was considered a useful strategy to protect immunocompromised patients from COVID-19 based on the phase 3 PROVENT trial conducted between November 2020 and March 2021. However, after late 2021, the dominant substrains of COVID-19 changed to Omicron substrains, which showed resistance to tixagevimab/cilgavimab. Therefore, it is important to re-evaluate the real-world efficacy of tixagevimab/cilgavimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in the Omicron era. To this end, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of tixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis for COVID-19 during the Omicron BA.5 wave in Japan. A total of 240 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies received tixagevimab/cilgavimab at our institution from October 18, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Among them, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at 90 days was 6.4%. A total of 10/14 (71.4%) had mild infection, and 4/14 (28.5%) had severe infection. No patient died due to COVID-19. Adverse events consisted of deep vein thrombosis in 2 patients. Our analysis indicated that pre-exposure prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab might have clinical effectiveness in reducing the severity of COVID-19 in Japanese HM patients, even in the Omicron BA.5 surge. It also suggested that tixagevimab/cilgavimab may be associated with cardiovascular complications.Copyright Â© 2023, Japanese Society of Hematology.",Kawashima I.; Hyuga H.; Nakadate A.; Matsuura M.; Sakamoto Y.; Suzuki J.; Kumagai T.; Suzuki M.; Koshiishi M.; Yamamoto T.; Nakajima K.; Tanaka M.; Kirito K.,,0925-5710,/10.1007/s12185-023-03663-2,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1007%2fs12185-023-03663-2,,,,42
6,Design of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors with improved affinity and reduced sensitivity to mutations,,"Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) such as nirmatrelvir (NTV) and ensitrelvir (ETV) have proven effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but the presence of resistance-conferring mutations in sequenced viral genomes raises concerns about future drug resistance. Second-generation oral drugs that retain function on these mutants are thus urgently needed. We hypothesized that the covalent HCV protease inhibitor boceprevir (BPV) could serve as the basis for orally bioavailable drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro more tightly than existing drugs. Performing structure-guided modifications of BPV, we developed a picomolar-affinity inhibitor, ML2006a4, with antiviral activity, oral pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy similar or superior to NTV. A crucial feature of ML2006a4 is a novel derivatization of the ketoamide reactive group that improves cell permeability and oral bioavailability. Finally, ML2006a4 is less sensitive to several mutations that cause resistance to NTV or ETV and occur in the natural SARS-CoV-2 population. Thus, anticipatory drug design can preemptively address potential resistance mechanisms.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

36,"Changes in the incidence, clinical features and outcomes of tuberculosis during COVID-19 pandemic",,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted tuberculosis (TB) services in many countries, but the impacts on sites of involvement, drug susceptibility, smear positivity and clinical outcomes, and clinical outcomes of co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 remain unclear. Method(s): Descriptive epidemiological study using episode-based and patient unique data of tuberculosis from Hospital Authority's territory-wide electronic medical record database, comparing baseline (January 2015-December 2019) and COVID-19 period (January 2020-December 2022), followed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Effects of co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 were investigated. Result(s): The study included 10,473 episodes of laboratory-confirmed TB, with 6818 in baseline period and 3655 during COVID-19 period. During COVID-19 period, TB patients had a lower proportion of smear positivity (49.2 % vs 54.7 %, P < 0.001), and fewer cases of extrapulmonary TB (7.0 % vs 8.0 %, P = 0.078) and multidrug resistant TB (1.0 % vs 1.6 %, P = 0.020). Mortality was higher in TB patients with COVID-19 coinfection (OR 1.7, P = 0.003) and influenza coinfection (OR 2.6, P = 0.004). During COVID-19 period, there were higher rates of treatment delay (20.5 % vs 15.5 %, P < 0.001) and episodic death (15.1 % vs 13.3 %, P = 0.006). Factors associated with higher mortality included age >= 70 years (OR 7.24), treatment delay (OR 2.16), extrapulmonary TB (OR 2.13). smear positivity (OR 1.71) and Charlson comorbidity index score >= 3 (OR 1.37).

In that sense, scientists are repurposing drugs meticulously to curb the nCOVID-19. New antiviral drugs on the other hand are being developed at unparallel rates. Among those Pfizer's inventive Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (PaxlovidTM), which inhibits the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, 3CL protease, will be another arrow in the quiver to mount resistance towards SARS-CoV-2. In patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within five days of symptom onset, COVID-19-related hospitalizations and mortality were dramatically reduced.

This retrospective cohort study reports a data analysis in Banner Healthcare System (a large not-for-profit organization) between 4/5/2022 and 8/1/2022 and included 19, 778 Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive (by PCR or direct antigen testing) patients who were selected from Cerner-Electronic Health Record after the exclusions criteria were met. The study index date for cohort was determined as the date of BEB MAb administration or the date of the first positive COVID-19 testing. The cohort consist of COVID-19 infected patients who received BEB MAb (N = 1, 091) compared to propensity score (PS) matched control (N = 1, 091). The primary composite outcome was the incidence of 30-day all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality. All statistical analyses were conducted on the paired (matched) dataset. For the primary composite outcome, the event counts and percentages were reported. Ninety-five percent Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for percentages were computed. The study cohorts were 1:1 propensity matched without replacement across 26 covariates using an optimal matching algorithm that minimizes the sum of absolute pairwise distance across the matched sample after fitting and using logistic regression as the distance function. The pairs were matched exactly on patient vaccination status, BMI group, age group and diabetes status. Compared to the PS matched control group (2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 3.7%), BEB MAb use (2.2%; 95% CI: 1.4%, 3.3%) did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary outcome (p = 0.67). In the subgroup analysis, we observed similar no-difference trends regarding the primary outcomes for the propensity rematched BEB MAb treated and untreated groups, stratified by patient vaccination status, age (<65 years or >=65), and immunocompromised status (patients with HIV/AIDS or solid organ transplants or malignancy including lymphoproliferative disorder). The number needed to treat (1/0.026-0.022) with BEB MAb was 250 to avoid one hospitalization and/or death over 30 days. The BEB MAb use lacked efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants (mainly BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5) in the Banner Healthcare System in the Southwestern United States.Copyright Â© 2023 Sridhara et al.

275,Potential Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) against Protease Inhibitors: Lessons Learned from HIV-1 Protease.,2022 Mar 23,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been one of the most devastating pandemics of recent times. The lack of potent novel antivirals had led to global health crises; however, emergence and approval of potent inhibitors of the viral main protease (Mpro), such as Pfizer's newly approved nirmatrelvir, offers hope not only in the therapeutic front but also in the context of prophylaxis against the infection. By their nature, RNA viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have inherently high mutation rates, and lessons learnt from previous and currently ongoing pandemics have taught us that these viruses can easily escape selection pressure through mutation of vital target amino acid residues in monotherapeutic settings. In this paper, we review nirmatrelvir and its binding to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and draw a comparison to inhibitors of HIV protease that were rendered obsolete by emergence of resistance mutations, emphasizing potential pitfalls in the design of inhibitors that may be of important relevance to the long-term use of novel inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.",Motyan JA; Mahdi M; Hoffka G; Tozser J,,,/10.3390/ijms23073507,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.3390%2fijms23073507,,,,47

57,"Selinexor, Daratumumab and Dexamethasone for Patients with Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated with Lenalidomide at First Relapse: A Real-World Study",,"INTRODUCTION: As lenalidomide becomes increasingly established standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), a significant number of patients may develop resistance to lenalidomide in their treatment, representing a clinically important population in need of effective therapies. Lenalidomide-refractory patients, who relapse quickly and have very poor outcomes, constitute a population with unmet medical needs. Selinexor is a selective inhibitor of exportin-1, leading to the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth regulator proteins in the nucleus. This results in reduced expression of several oncoproteins, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. Previous data indicate that the biology associated with resistance to the monoclonal antibody daratumumab is linked to sensitivity to selinexor (ASH 2021), and selinexor conbombined with daratumumab and dexamethasone (SDd) is a well-tolerated and effective option for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) (Gasparetto C, 2020). Here, we present the safety and preliminary efficacy findings from the first study of SDd combination therapy in Chinese patients with multiple myeloma who refractory to lenalidomide at first relapse (NCT05559788). METHOD(S): This study is a single-arm, prospective, non-interventional, real-world study that enrolled pts who had previously received one-line anti-myeloma treatment. Subjects were treated with selinexor (60 mg QW) in combination with daratumumab (16 mg/kg per label) and dexamethasone (40 mg QW) in 28-day cycles until PD, death or patients' withdrawal. Data collected included treatment response, patient characteristics such as age, sex, multiple myeloma features (cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridization, type, stage, anti-myeloma treatment, and stem cell transplantation [SCT] status), and patients' survival. RESULT(S): Between Feb 1, 2023, and May 30, 2023, a total of 8 RRMM pts were enrolled and received treatment at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The median age was 63 years (range 44-78), with all pts (100%) had R-ISS stage II/III disease. Among them, 6 (75%) pts were classified as high risk or above by mSMART risk stratification, and 4 (50%) pts had extramedullary disease (EMD). All 8 (100%) pts were refractory to lenalidomide, and 7(87.5%)have received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) (Table 1). At the end of one course, 6 patients (75%) achieved remission (3 very good partial responses [VGPR] and 3 partial responses [PR]). Among the 4 pts with EMD, 1 pt showed progressive disease (PD) after two courses, 1 pt showed stable disease (SD), and 2 pt achieved PR and VGPR but progressed after four and two courses, respectively. The data suggests that SDd combination therapy brings about rapid remission in EMD patients, while the duration of response may be shorter. Therefore, for these patients, it is crucial to closely monitor and plan for the next steps of treatment after achieving rapid remission. All four remaining non-EMD pts achieved remission, three of whom are continuing treatment (one died of COVID-19). Four patients were infected with COVID-19 during the treatment process. One pt was asymptomatic and detected positive with virus infection by antigen test screening. Among the three pts with symptoms, one had fever, cough, and pneumonia, and one had multiple organ failure (MOF). Three pts received antiviral medication (two with Paxlovid and one with Molnupiravir), and three recovered, but the one with MOF died. The SDd treatment was interrupted in all four pts, with a median time of 18 days (range: 12 to 21 days), until COVID-19 turned negative. The most common grade 3 adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia (25%), anemia (13%), and neutropenia (13%). Non-hematological AEs were mainly grade 1-2. Three patients had dose reductions due to myelosuppression. CONCLUSION(S): This real-world study demonstrates that SDd combination therapy led to early, deep responses in lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma patients at their first relapse. Considering that patients with extramedullary disease had limited benefit from SDd treatment, future study designs may restrict the recruitment of such patients.Copyright Â© 2023 The American Society of Hematology",Zhai Y.; Yan L.; Jin S.; Shang J.; Shi X.; Yao W.; Yan Z.; Yan S.; Wu D.-P.; Fu C.,,0006-4971,/10.1182/blood-2023-185540,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1182%2fblood-2023-185540,,,,49
47,Tocilizumab treatment in MOGAD: a case report and literature review,,"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-immunoglobulin G associated disease (MOGAD) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) which usually occurs with recurrent optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, acute disseminating encephalomyelitis, or brainstem encephalitis. To date, the anti-CD 20 drug rituximab (RTX) is employed in MOGAD although some authors reported the efficacy of Tocilizumab (TCZ) in refractory patients. We present the case of a woman affected by refractory MOGAD who was treated with TCZ after therapy with RTX had failed to prevent relapses. We also conducted a current literature review on TCZ use in MOGAD. A 57-year-old Caucasian woman affected by MOGAD with severe motor impairment and cognitive dysfunction was treated from 2020 to February 2022 with RTX. However, she experienced progressive clinical and cognitive worsening associated with white matter lesions mimicking leukodystrophy. In February 2022, the patient started therapy with TCZ administered with improvement of cognitive performance, walking ability, and brainstem functions. During TCZ, our patient reached the condition of NEDA-3 (no relapse, no increase in disability, no MRI activity on neuroimaging follow-up performed in September 2023). Moreover, the patient experienced paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not modify TCZ schedule. To date, there are few evidence on the efficacy and safety of TCZ in MOGAD. However, all the reviewed cases showed that TCZ represents an effective therapy in drug-resistant MOGAD. Our case highlights the efficacy of TCZ in drug resistant MOGAD and strengthens previous reports of TCZ safety and efficacy in MOGAD.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.",Schiro G.; Iacono S.; Andolina M.; Bianchi A.; Ragonese P.; Salemi G.,,1590-1874,/10.1007/s10072-023-07189-7,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1007%2fs10072-023-07189-7,,,,50

This study applies a patient-informed value element framework for future patient-centered value assessment of mild/moderate COVID therapies. Method(s): We searched PubMed [December 21, 2021] to identify relevant publications using the string: ""(mild OR moderate) AND (COVID OR coronavirus 2019 OR COVID19) AND (bamlanivimab OR estesevimab OR sotrovimab OR casirivimab OR imdevimab OR REGN-COV2) OR (paxlovid) OR (molnupiravir)"". Publications in 2020 or later that discussed mild/moderate COVID-19 were included. We abstracted information relevant to treatment effects and costs and clinical and humanistic outcomes. We mapped positive and negative treatment attributes to the patient-informed value element framework domains (treatment effects, access, cost, life impact, and social impact). Result(s): Of the 140 papers identified, 34 met inclusion criteria. For Mabs, positive aspects are treatment effects (i.e., recovery time, long permissible window from symptom onset to treatment initiation, few/no drug-drug interactions), access (i.e., ease of coordination between providers and infusion centers), and cost (i.e., affordability-currently free of charge). Negative aspects are life impact (i.e., missed work/school due to >=3 hours for infusion appointments), treatment effects (i.e., viral resistance, no safety data for pediatric/pregnant women), access (i.e., limited availability, transportation/distance to infusion centers), and costs (i.e., infusion-related out-of-pocket costs). For oral therapies, positive aspects are treatment effects (i.e., rapid clinical improvement, low risk of hospitalization/death, resistance to viral variants), access (i.e., home administration), and cost (i.e., affordability). Negative aspects include treatment effects (i.e., duration of treatment, viral resistance if non-adherent, pill burden, mutagenicity/teratogenicity concerns) and access (i.e., limited supply). Conclusion(s): Potential impacts on productivity and patient costs suggest that therapies for mild/moderate COVID-19 should be assessed with evaluations that include the patient-informed value elements.Copyright Â© 2022",Ali C.; Mattingly T.J.; Slejko J.F.; Dosreis S.,,1098-3015,/10.1016/j.jval.2022.04.1424,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.jval.2022.04.1424,,,,51
46,SARS-CoV-2 resistance to monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule drugs,,"Over four years have passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific response has been rapid and effective, with many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecules developed for clinical use. However, given the ability for viruses to become resistant to antivirals, it is perhaps no surprise that the field has identified resistance to nearly all of these compounds. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the resistance profile for each of these therapeutics. We hope that this resource provides an atlas for mutations to be aware of for each agent, particularly as a springboard for considerations for the next generation of antivirals. Finally, we discuss the outlook and thoughts for moving forward in how we continue to manage this, and the next, pandemic.Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Iketani S.; Ho D.D.,,2451-9456,/10.1016/j.chembiol.2024.03.008,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.chembiol.2024.03.008,,,,52
3,Resistance mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to the non-covalent inhibitor WU-04,,"Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we identified two double mutations, M49K/M165V and M49K/S301P, in the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) that confer resistance to a novel non-covalent inhibitor, WU-04. Crystallographic analysis indicates that the M49K mutation destabilizes the WU-04 binding pocket, impacting the binding of WU-04 more significantly than the binding of 3CLpro substrates. The M165V mutation directly interferes with WU-04 binding. The S301P mutation, which is far from the WU-04 binding pocket, indirectly affects WU-04 binding by restricting the rotation of 3CLpro's C-terminal tail and impeding 3CLpro dimerization. We further explored 3CLpro mutations that confer resistance to two clinically used inhibitors: ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir, and revealed a trade-off between the catalytic activity, thermostability, and drug resistance of 3CLpro. We found that mutations at the same residue (M49) can have distinct effects on the 3CLpro inhibitors, highlighting the importance of developing multiple antiviral agents with different skeletons for fighting SARS-CoV-2. These findings enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 resistance mechanisms and inform the development of effective therapeutics.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

225,"Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir, or Sotrovimab for High-Risk COVID-19 Patients Infected by the Omicron Variant: Hospitalization, Mortality, and Time until Negative Swab Test in Real Life.",2023 May 09,"Background. Several drugs which are easy to administer in outpatient settings have been authorized and endorsed for high-risk COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease to prevent hospital admission and death, complementing COVID-19 vaccines. However, the evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 antivirals during the Omicron wave is scanty or conflicting. Methods. This retrospective controlled study investigated the efficacy of Molnupiravir or Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid R) or Sotrovimab against standard of care (controls) on three different endpoints among 386 high-risk COVID-19 outpatients: hospital admission at 30 days; death at 30 days; and time between COVID-19 diagnosis and first negative swab test result. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to investigate the determinants of hospitalization due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia, whereas time to first negative swab test result was investigated by means of multinomial logistic analysis as well as Cox regression analysis. Results. Only 11 patients (overall rate of 2.8%) developed severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia requiring admission to hospital: 8 controls (7.2%); 2 patients on Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (2.0%); and 1 on Sotrovimab (1.8%). No patient on Molnupiravir was institutionalized. Compared to controls, hospitalization was less likely for patients on Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (aOR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03; 0.89) or Molnupiravir (omitted estimate); drug efficacy was 84% for Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir against 100% for Molnupiravir. Only two patients died of COVID-19 (rate of 0.5%), both were controls, one (a woman aged 96 years) was unvaccinated and the other (a woman aged 72 years) had adequate vaccination status. At Cox regression analysis, the negativization rate was significantly higher in patients treated with both antivirals-Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (aHR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.25; 2.26) or Molnupiravir (aHR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.08; 1.94). However, COVID-19 vaccination with three (aHR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.51; 2.73) or four (aHR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.32; 4.68) doses had a slightly stronger effect size on viral clearance. In contrast, the negativization rate reduced significantly in patients who were immune-depressed (aHR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52; 0.93) or those with a Charlson index >=5 (aHR = 0.63; 0.41; 0.95) or those who had started the respective treatment course 3+ days after COVID-19 diagnosis (aOR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38; 0.82). Likewise, at internal analysis (excluding patients on standard of care), patients on Molnupiravir (aHR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.21; 2.50) or Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (aHR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.32; 2.93) were more likely to turn negative earlier than those on Sotrovimab (reference category). Nonetheless, three (aHR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.33; 2.74) or four (aHR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.06; 4.59) doses of COVID-19 vaccine were again associated with a faster negativization rate. Again, the negativization rate was significantly lower if treatment started 3+ days after COVID-19 diagnosis (aHR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.32; 0.92). Conclusions. Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir, and Sotrovimab were all effective in preventing hospital admission and/or mortality attributable to COVID-19. However, hospitalizations also decreased with higher number of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Although they are effective against severe disease and mortality, the prescription of COVID-19 antivirals should be carefully scrutinized by double opinion, not only to contain health care costs but also to reduce the risk of generating resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains. Only 64.7% of patients were in fact immunized with 3+ doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the present study. High-risk patients should prioritize COVID-19 vaccination, which is a more cost-effective approach than antivirals against severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Likewise, although both antivirals, especially Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir, were more likely than standard of care and Sotrovimab to reduce viral shedding time (VST) in high-risk SARS-CoV-2 patients, vaccination had an independent and stronger effect on viral clearance. However, the effect of antivirals or COVID-19 vaccination on VST should be considered a secondary benefit. Indeed, recommending Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir in order to control VST in high-risk COVID-19 patients is rather questionable since other cheap, large spectrum and harmless nasal disinfectants such as hypertonic saline solutions are available on the market with proven efficacy in containing VST.",Cegolon L; Pol R; Simonetti O; Larese Filon F; Luzzati R,,1424-8247,/10.3390/ph16050721,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm8&DO=10.3390%2fph16050721,,,,54

The ongoing state of pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, and the availability of new drugs necessitate their updating. Changes introduced in the current version of recommendations for the management of COVID-19 comprised the possibility of using remedesivir in an outpatient setting, previously reserved for inpatient treatment, as well as other antiviral drugs-molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir. We revised the possibility of using monoclonal antibodies due to the resistance of the currently dominant Omicron variant. Anakinra, an antagonist of interleukin 1 receptors, has been added as a treatment option in advanced stages of the disease, and the recommended daily dose of glucocorticosteroids used in the most severe forms of COVID-19 has been increased.

84,Interactions of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Agents Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir/Paxlovid with Human Drug Transporters,,"Orally administered small molecules may have important therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19 disease. The recently developed antiviral agents, Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir, have been reported to be efficient treatments, with only moderate side effects, especially when applied in the early phases of this disease. However, drug-drug and drug-transporter interactions have already been noted by the drug development companies and in the application notes. In the present work, we have studied some of the key human transporters interacting with these agents. The nucleoside analog Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) and its main metabolite (EIDD-1931) were found to inhibit CNT1,2 in addition to the ENT1,2 nucleoside transporters; however, it did not significantly influence the relevant OATP transporters or the ABCC4 nucleoside efflux transporter. The active component of Paxlovid (PF-07321332, Nirmatrelvir) inhibited the function of several OATPs and of ABCB1 but did not affect ABCG2. However, significant inhibition was observed only at high concentrations of Nirmatrelvir and probably did not occur in vivo. Paxlovid, as used in the clinic, is a combination of Nirmatrelvir (viral protease inhibitor) and Ritonavir (a ""booster"" inhibitor of Nirmatrelvir metabolism). Ritonavir is known to inhibit several drug transporters; therefore, we have examined these compounds together, in relevant concentrations and ratios. No additional inhibitory effect of Nirmatrelvir was observed compared to the strong transporter inhibition caused by Ritonavir. Our current in vitro results should help to estimate the potential drug-drug interactions of these newly developed agents during COVID-19 treatment.Copyright Â© 2023 by the authors.",Bakos E.; Temesszentandrasi-Ambrus C.; Ozvegy-Laczka C.; Gaborik Z.; Sarkadi B.; Telbisz A.,,1661-6596,/10.3390/ijms241411237,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.3390%2fijms241411237,,,,57

144,Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Canada during Coronavirus Disease 2019,,"Dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a monumental test of medical skills and resources worldwide. The management of community-Acquired pneumonia (CAP) can at times be difficult, but treating CAP in the setting of COVID-19 can be particularly trying and confusing and raises a number of challenging questions relating to etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article is based on the authors' experiences and presents an overview of how CAP during COVID-19 is handled in Canada. We touch on the issues of microbial etiology in patients with CAP in the setting of COVID-19 as well as diagnostic, site of care, and treatment approaches. Published guidelines are the basis of management of CAP and are discussed in the context of Canadian data. We also outline the usual treatment approaches to COVID-19, particularly in patients who have been hospitalized.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

172,Pomotrelvir and Nirmatrelvir Binding and Reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: Implications for Resistance Mechanisms from Computations.,2024 Oct 01,"We investigate the inhibition mechanism between pomotrelvir and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a gamma-lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a delta-lactam ring is a good alternative for the design of inhibitors for variants presenting mutations at position 166. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are preferred with respect to secondary amines. Flexible side chains at the P2 position can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non-reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2 group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, named as C2, that presents a better binding free energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2. We hope that these findings could be useful to design better inhibitors to fight present and future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors.

197,Evaluation of in vitro antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor pomotrelvir and cross-resistance to nirmatrelvir resistance substitutions.,2023 11 15,"The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants underscore the need for broadly active inhibitors with a high barrier to resistance. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an essential cysteine protease required for viral polyprotein processing and is highly conserved across human coronaviruses. Pomotrelvir is a novel Mpro inhibitor that has recently completed a phase 2 clinical trial. In this report, we demonstrated that pomotrelvir is a potent competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with high selectivity against human proteases. In the enzyme assay, pomotrelvir is also active against Mpro proteins derived from human coronaviruses CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, CoV-NL63, MERS, and SARS-CoV. In cell-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon and SARS-CoV-2 infection assays, pomotrelvir has shown potent inhibitory activity and is broadly active against SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates including Omicron variants. Many resistance substitutions of the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir confer cross-resistance to pomotrelvir, consistent with the finding from our enzymatic analysis that pomotrelvir and nirmatrelvir compete for the same binding site. In a SARS-CoV-2 infection assay, pomotrelvir is additive when combined with remdesivir or molnupiravir, two nucleoside analogs targeting viral RNA synthesis. In conclusion, our results from the in vitro characterization of pomotrelvir antiviral activity support its further clinical development as an alternative COVID-19 therapeutic option.",Tong X; Keung W; Arnold LD; Stevens LJ; Pruijssers AJ; Kook S; Lopatin U; Denison M; Kwong AD,,,/10.1128/aac.00840-23,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1128%2faac.00840-23,,,,61
220,Study of key residues in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases for resistance against clinically applied inhibitors nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir.,2024,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an epidemic, zoonotically emerging pathogen initially reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV has the potential to mutate or recombine with other coronaviruses, thus acquiring the ability to efficiently spread among humans and become pandemic. Its high mortality rate of up to 35% and the absence of effective targeted therapies call for the development of antiviral drugs for this pathogen. Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, extensive research has focused on identifying protease inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Our intention was therefore to assess whether these protease inhibitors are viable options for combating MERS-CoV. To that end, we used previously established protease assays to quantify inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and other main proteases. Nirmatrelvir inhibited several of these proteases, whereas ensitrelvir was less broadly active. To simulate nirmatrelvir's clinical use against MERS-CoV and subsequent resistance development, we applied a safe, surrogate virus-based system. Using the surrogate virus, we previously selected hallmark mutations of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro, such as T21I, M49L, S144A, E166A/K/V and L167F. In the current study, we selected a pool of MERS-CoV-Mpro mutants, characterized the resistance and modelled the steric effect of catalytic site mutants S142G, S142R, S147Y and A171S.

115,USING REAL WORLD EVIDENCE (RWE) TO ASSESS DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION (DDI) BETWEEN PAXLOVID AND THE TOP 100 PRESCRIBED DRUGS IN THE US,,"BACKGROUND: Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) has received a US Emergency Use Authorization for patients >=12 years with mild-to- moderate COVID-19 at high-risk of progression to severe disease. DDI studies conducted with Paxlovid implicate the PK enhancer ritonavir as the main perpetrator of DDIs. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and P-gp. The Paxlovid Fact Sheet1 identifies contraindicated drugs and those with a potentially important interaction. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis was conducted using RWE from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart. Patients were identified based on CDC criteria for high-risk COVID-19 and confirmed continuous insurance enrollment from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2019 with >=1 prescription claim. Excluding non-drug claims (e.g., vaccines), the top 100 drugs were selected and ranked based on total patient counts. DDI potential with Paxlovid was evaluated using US Prescribing and DailyMed Information or relevant literature for each drug. RESULT(S): Of the top 100, 70 drugs are not expected to have a DDI with Paxlovid. These drugs are eliminated unchanged in urine, cleared by enzymes other than CYP3A4 or CYP2D6, are not P-gp substrates, or are cleared by multiple pathways. The remaining 30 drugs expected to have a DDI are represented in the Paxlovid Fact Sheet. The top four drug classes expected to interact with Paxlovid include corticosteroids, narcotic analgesics, anticoagulants, and statins. One drug, simvastatin, is contraindicated. The mechanism of interaction with Paxlovid, or lack thereof, will be presented in detail for each drug. CONCLUSION(S): Paxlovid DDI management is important to ensure the right patients receive this antiviral. This analysis provides an understanding of Paxlovid interactions with the top 100 drugs likely to be used in high-risk COVID-19 patients and serves as an additional DDI management resource.",Gerhart J.; Draica F.; Benigno M.; Sidhu G.; Atkinson J.; Reimbaeva M.; Francis D.; Baillon-Plot N.; Damle B.,,1532-6535,/10.1002/cpt.2835,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1002%2fcpt.2835,,,,63
183,SARS-CoV-2 evolution has increased resistance to monoclonal antibodies and first-generation COVID-19 vaccines: Is there a future therapeutic role for soluble ACE2 receptors for COVID-19?.,2024 Jul,"COVID-19 has caused calamitous health, economic and societal consequences. Although several COVID-19 vaccines have received full authorization for use, global deployment has faced political, financial and logistical challenges. The efficacy of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines is waning and breakthrough infections are allowing ongoing transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccine efficacy relies on a functional immune system. Despite receiving three primary doses and three or more heterologous boosters, some immunocompromised patients may not be adequately protected by COVID-19 vaccines and remain vulnerable to severe disease. The evolution of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has also resulted in the rapid obsolescence of monoclonal antibodies. Convalescent plasma from COVID-19 survivors has produced inconsistent results. New drugs such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) are beyond the reach of low- and middle-income countries. With widespread use of Paxlovid, it is likely nirmatrelvir-resistant clades of SARS-CoV-2 will emerge in the future. There is thus an urgent need for new effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments. The in vitro efficacy of soluble ACE2 against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including omicron (B.1.1.529), was recently described using a competitive ELISA assay as a surrogate marker for virus neutralization. This indicates soluble wild-type ACE2 receptors are likely to be resistant to viral evolution. Nasal and inhaled treatment with soluble ACE2 receptors has abrogated severe disease in animal models of COVID-19. There is an urgent need for clinical trials of this new class of antiviral therapeutics, which could complement vaccines and Paxlovid. Copyright Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.

34,"Carrimycin, as One of the Drugs in Combination Therapy, for the Treatment of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii Infection",,"Purpose: Infection with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is a tough nut to crack. Carrimycin is a novel recombinant macrolide antibiotic, and has good anti-infection effects in vivo. At present, it is rarely reported for treatment of CRAB infection. We present a case where a patient with COVID-19 complicated by CRAB infection was successfully treated with a combination therapy including carrimycin, offering clinical insights and experience. Patients and Methods: The patient infected with CRAB was cured by carrimycin combined with tigecycline and amikacin ultimately. We analyzed and summarized the therapeutic regimen and disease feature to provide reference for clinical treatment. Result(s): The patient was admitted to emergency observation wards with fever and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. During the treatment, his condition worsened. He had a fever, cough, and expectoration. After 3 days of empirical treatment with meropenem, tested positive for A. baumannii infection by the next-generation sequencing, and CRAB was detected in blood and sputum culture. Then, he was administered with tigecycline and amikacin immediately for 5 days, however the therapeutic effect was not significant. The patient still remained in a high inflammatory response. Ultimately, the treatment regimen was changed to carrimycin combined with tigecycline and amikacin for 7 days, and then carrimycin combined with tigecycline for 10 days, the patient's clinical condition gradually improved. The patient received carrimycin monotherapy for 7 days, then discharged. Conclusion(s): Carrimycin may be a bright alternative for CRAB infection as one of the drugs in combination therapy, especially in a patient with hyperinflammatory response.Copyright Â© 2024 Du et al.",Du N.; You D.; Tenzing D.; Qu D.; Meng J.; Wang Y.; He J.,,1178-6973 (electronic),/10.2147/IDR.S468413,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.2147%2fIDR.S468413,,,,65
65,The effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on tacrolimus levels in lung transplant recipients: A single-center study,,"Background: Lung transplant recipients (LTRs) have a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 compared with the immunocompetent population. The use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NR), an effective oral treatment for COVID-19, is quite challenging due to its potent drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressants and azole antifungals. As there are few clinical reports of the use of NR in LTRs, we measured tacrolimus levels in patients receiving NR in our hospital to improve safety when prescribing NR. Method(s): In total, 48 adult LTRs who received NR between November 19, 2022, and January 19, 2023, at China-Japan Friendship Hospital were retrospectively included and followed for 20 days after initiating NR. Tacrolimus was held at least 12 h before initiating NR and re-administered based on the trough levels after completing NR treatment. All concomitant medications, drug concentrations, laboratory results, and genotypes were recorded and analyzed. Result(s): Most patients showed stable tacrolimus trough levels despite high individual variability. Four patients exhibited supratherapeutic trough levels of tacrolimus (more than 15 ng/mL). Two patients who received 0.5 mg of tacrolimus during NR treatment had trough levels below 3.0 ng/mL. In addition, we found that in 13 patients, the trough levels were 130% of baseline after cessation of tacrolimus, and logistic regression revealed that increased trough level was significantly associated with age more than 60 years. Conclusion(s): NR can be safely used in LTRs with close monitoring of tacrolimus levels and appropriate dose adjustments. However, more attention should be paid to elderly patients, as NR may more severely affect their drug metabolism. Due to the limited sample size, further studies are needed to guide the optimal use of tacrolimus following treatment with NR and explore the risk factors significantly affecting the interactions between NR and tacrolimus.Copyright Â© 2023",Wang X.; Du W.; Zhang D.; Chen W.; Zuo X.,,1094-5539,/10.1016/j.pupt.2023.102280,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.pupt.2023.102280,,,,66

43,475. 'The Outcomes and Adverse Effects of COVID-19 Therapies in High-Risk Children',,"Background. Numerous international studies have focused on the outcomes of COVID-19 therapies in adults, however data are limited on the outcomes for high-risk paediatric patients treated with similar agents. Methods. Data was collected retrospectively for high-risk children treated for symptomatic COVID-19 at a tertiary paediatric hospital in Australia, over a 12-month period (September 2021- August 2022). Indications for COVID-19 therapies are outlined in [Figure 1]; with the guideline being implemented in September, 2021. Note: Casirivimab-imdevimab & sotrovimab were included in previous iterations of the COVID-19 algorithm. Due to increased resistance with newer strains of the dominant Omicron variant, these therapies were removed from the algorithm in April 2022. Results. A total of 139 children were treated with COVID-19 therapies based on having a significant underlying comorbidity meeting criteria [Table 1].Symptomatic, non-hypoxic COVID-19; The majority (102, 73%) received treatment for symptomatic, non-hypoxic COVID-19 [Table 2]. Three drug-related adverse events were noted that resolved with treatment cessation; an infusion reaction with sotrovimab; taste disturbance with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; and elevated liver enzymes with remdesivir [Table 3]. Six (2.9%) children re-presented within 90 days of therapy requiring hospitalisation [Table 4]; 4 (3.9%) with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms requiring monitoring and 2 (2%) with suspected secondary infections.Symptomatic, hypoxic COVID-19; Thirty-seven (26.6 %) children were treated for symptomatic, hypoxic COVID-19 [Table 2]. Of these, 31 (83.8%) received dexamethasone; 9 (24.3%) remdesivir; 5 (13.5%) baricitinib; 5 (13.5%) tocilizumab, 1 (2.7%) sotrovimab and 1 (2.7%) anakinra. One death occurred, attributed to complications secondary to a bone marrow transplant and was unrelated to COVID-19 directed therapy. There were no other adverse effects. Early cessation of therapies prior to course completion was indicative of symptom resolution and discharge from hospital. Overall clinical course for symptomatic, hypoxic COVID-19 patients is outlined in Table 5. Hospitalisation within 90 days of receiving COVID-19 therapies was required for 4 (10.8%) patients; 3 (8.1%) with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms requiring monitoring and 1 (2.7%) with a suspected secondary infection [Table 4]. Conclusion. The use of directed COVID-19 therapies in high-risk paediatric patients were largely well-tolerated and side effects self-resolved upon treatment cessation.",Holschier J.; Boast A.; Plover C.; Boyce S.; McNab S.; Curtis N.; Gwee A.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.545,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofad500.545,,,,68
119,A commentary on the use of pharmacoenhancers in the pharmaceutical industry and the implication for DMPK drug discovery strategies,,"Paxlovid, a drug combining nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, was designed for the treatment of COVID-19 and its rapid development has led to emergency use approval by the FDA to reduce the impact of COVID-19 infection on patients. In order to overcome potentially suboptimal therapeutic exposures, nirmatrelvir is dosed in combination with ritonavir to boost the pharmacokinetics of the active product. Here we consider examples of drugs co-administered with pharmacoenhancers. Pharmacoenhancers have been adopted for multiple purposes such as ensuring therapeutic exposure of the active product, reducing formation of toxic metabolites, changing the route of administration, and increasing the cost-effectiveness of a therapy. We weigh the benefits and risks of this approach, examining the impact of technology developments on drug design and how enhanced integration between cross-discipline teams can improve the outcome of drug discovery.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s).

50,Abstract 1217 SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitor High-Throughput Screen,,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, SARS2) is responsible for the first global pandemic of the 21st century, and infections continue to affect the lives of millions of people each day. The SARS2 main protease enzyme (Mpro) is considered an excellent drug target due to conservation across this virus family and dissimilarity to human proteases. However, the first clinical drug for Mpro, Paxlovid (active component - Nirmatrelvir), is potentially susceptible to resistance mutations. In an effort to develop inhibitors that are less susceptible to resistance, our team has created a robust cell-based assay for Mpro activity and used it in a primary high throughput screen of a library of 649,568 compounds. This primary screen identified 8,777 candidate inhibitors (1.35% hit rate). A secondary biochemical screen was used to pick out potential direct binders and activity inhibitors. This strategy resulted in several dozen dose-responsive inhibitors including a few previously reported compounds such as Calpain inhibitor II. This presentation will discuss the screening assays, approaches, and the mechanisms of action of select inhibitors.

85,SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Medicinal Chemistry Research,,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of deaths and threatens public health and safety. Nowadays, modern society has faced a new challenging problem, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). In this context, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, having more than 60 mutations when compared to its ancestral wild-type virus, has infected many individuals around the world. It is rapidly spread person-to-person due to its increased transmissibility. Additionally, it was demonstrated that this newest variant and its subvariants have the capability of evading the host immune system, being resistant to neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, it has been proven to be resistant to monoclonal antibodies and several different vaccines. This ability is associated with a huge number of mutations associated with its spike (S) glycoprotein, which presents at least 15 mutations. These mutations are able to modify the way how this virus interacts with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), increasing its infectivity and making the therapeutic alternatives more ineffective. Concerning its chymotrypsin-like picornavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), it has been seen that some compounds can be active against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, in a similar mode than its wild-type precursor. This broad spectrum of action for some drugs could be attributed to the fact that the currently identified mutations found in 3CLpro and RNA proteins being localized near the catalytic binding site, conserving their activities. Herein this review, we provide a great and unprecedented compilation of all identified and/or repurposed compounds/drugs against this threatening variant, Omicron. The main targets for those compounds are the protein-protein interface (PPI) of S protein with ACE2, 3CLpro, RdRp, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein. Some of these studies have presented only in silico data, having a lack of experimental results to prove their findings. However, these should be considered here since other research teams can use their observations to design and investigate new potential agents. Finally, we believe that our review will contribute to several studies that are in progress worldwide, compiling several interesting aspects about VOCs associated with SARS-CoV2, as well as describing the results for different chemical classes of compounds that could be promising as prototypes for designing new and more effective antiviral agents.Copyright Â© 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",Rocha W.S.; Zhan P.; da Silva-Junior E.F.,,1568-0266,/10.2174/1568026623666230411095417,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.2174%2f1568026623666230411095417,,,,73
102,Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir: Oral Coronavirus Disease 2019 Antiviral Drugs,,"At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged >=18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged >=12 years weighing >=40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration.

80,Managing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) interactions in general practice,,"Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is indicated in patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Many of these patients are concomitantly prescribed various medications for other indications. Ritonavir has no activity against SARS-CoV-2, but, administered with nirmatrelvir, acts as a pharmacokinetic booster, increasing nirmatrelvir's efficacy. Ritonavir can simultaneously change other medicines' plasma levels, affecting their safety and therapeutic effects. Ritonavir's potential to cause clinically significant interactions is well documented, as it has a long history of being used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other antiviral agents. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a well-known phenomenon, but data on the clinical impact of Paxlovid DDIs is still insufficient. Ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19 is only administered for 5 days; therefore, uncertainty exists on how the coad-ministration of various medicines should be managed. Numerous Paxlovid DDIs can lead to serious adverse drug reactions; therefore, careful analysis of all concomitantly prescribed medicines is essential to ensure treatment safety. This article aims to summarise currently available information on Paxlovid DDIs that may be relevant for general practitioners. It explains the main mechanisms leading to pharmacokinetic interactions and possible options for DDIs management. The authors indicate sources of information that may be helpful to prescribers when weighing the benefits and risks of Paxlovid co-administration with other medicines.Copyright Â© Wydawnictwo Continuo.",Mirowska-Guzel D.; Niedzielko M.; Kulakowski R.,,1734-3402,/10.5114/fmpcr.2023.130097,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.5114%2ffmpcr.2023.130097,,,,75
249,Structural basis of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir activity against naturally occurring polymorphisms of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,2023 03,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The main viral protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for antivirals. The clinically approved drug nirmatrelvir and the clinical candidate ensitrelvir have so far showed great potential for treatment of viral infection. However, the broad use of antivirals is often associated with resistance generation. Herein, we enzymatically characterized 14 naturally occurring Mpro polymorphisms that are close to the binding site of these antivirals. Nirmatrelvir retained its potency against most polymorphisms tested, while mutants G143S and Q189K were associated with diminished inhibition constants. For ensitrelvir, diminished inhibition constants were observed for polymorphisms M49I, G143S, and R188S, but not for Q189K, suggesting a distinct resistance profile between inhibitors. In addition, the crystal structures of selected polymorphisms revealed interactions that were critical for loss of potency. In conclusion, our data will assist the monitoring of potential resistant strains, support the design of combined therapy, as well as assist the development of the next generation of Mpro inhibitors.

73,Pay attention to the safety management of conditional marketing authorization drugs for coronavirus disease 2019,,"At present, 3 drugs specially for coronavirus disease 2019 have conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in China, including molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and azvudine. The data of clinical efficacy and safety of these drugs are relatively insufficient. Molnupiravir is not the main inhibitor or inducer of drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter and is less likely to have drug interactions, which may be more beneficial to patients with chronic diseases needing long-term drug treatments. Ritonavir in Paxlovid is a strong inhibitor to the key drug metabolism enzyme-CYP3A4, and may interact with a variety of drugs such as drugs for arrhythmia, diabetes, nervous system diseases, etc., resulting in increased drug safety risks in the treatment of underlying diseases. The reproductive and genetic toxicity recorded in the drug label of azvudine is worrying. Joint efforts of our government, hospital managers, clinicians and pharmacists are necessary to achieve the safety management of the 3 drugs, including improving the relevant CMA management regulations, strengthening the efficacy and safety monitoring of these drugs, conducting real world clinical research, and monitoring the variation and drug resistance of the virus.Copyright Â© 2023 Authors.

88,The Effectiveness of Bivalent mRNA Omicron Containing Booster Vaccines Among Patients With Hematological Neoplasms,,"Background/Aim: Last year was characterized by the appearance of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, mainly the omicron sub-lineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, which have confirmed resistance to the acquired immune response developed following first-generation mRNA vaccines. Given the ability to use mRNA technology to respond quickly to variant strains, novel bivalent vaccines against novel omicron variants were generated. In the current work, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of novel bivalent mRNA Omicroncontaining booster vaccines among patients with hematological neoplasms, including both lymphoproliferative and myeloid malignancies. Patients and Methods: Cohort patients were obtained from electronic medical records of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second-largest healthcare organization in Israel. We analyzed the outcome of all patients with hematological neoplasms, between September 21, 2022, and December 31, 2022, who were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the proportion of patients hospitalized for SARSCoV- 2 infection within 30 days among recipients and nonrecipients of omicron vaccine. Result(s): During the study period, 472 patients were infected with Omicron. We compared the outcome of 70 patients who received the bivalent mRNA booster to 402 who did not. Fewer bivalent recipients needed COVID-19-related hospitalization [2 of 70 (2.9%)] in comparison to the non-vaccinated cohort [42 of 402 (10.4%)] (p-value=0.0304). This represents an 89% relative risk reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization in patients with hematological neoplasms. The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days for the non-vaccinated group and 4 for the vaccinated group. A statistically significant increase in ischemic stroke rates due to bivalent mRNA Omicron-containing booster vaccine was not observed. Conclusion(s): The bivalent Omicron-containing vaccine mRNA booster has a protective effect in preventing and shortening hospitalization in patients with hematological neoplasms with an acceptable safety profile.Copyright Â© 2023 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

124,Evaluating Riociguat in the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: A Real-World Perspective,,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a broad term describing the mean pulmonary artery pressure, as measured by right heart catheterization, exceeds 20mmHg. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) exists when PH is accompanied by a normal wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. PAH is typified by dysmorphic and dysfunctional pulmonary arterial vasculature. Attempting to restore the functionality of the pulmonary artery is a hallmark of care to the PAH patient. Riociguat is a powerful stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase and increases blood flow through the pulmonary arteries by dilating vascular smooth muscle cells. This review examines the pharmacology of riociguat, the fundamental clinical trials applying it to PAH patients, practical aspects when selecting its use, and future directions for its utilization.Copyright Â© 2022 Mihalek et al.",Mihalek A.D.; Scott C.D.; Mazimba S.,,1176-6344,/10.2147/VHRM.S383572,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.2147%2fVHRM.S383572,,,,79
79,Very low COVID mortality and hospitalization rates in CLL and MBL with repeated vaccination to maximum antibody response,,"Introduction: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and monoclonal B-lymphocytosis (MBL) have impaired immunity and high risk of severe COVID infection, hospitalization, and death. The current dominant Omicron variants XBB are now resistant to the prophylactic monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab (T + C). Hence vaccination, and anti-viral therapy, are the only remaining measures against severe infection. Australia had very low COVID infection numbers from January 2020 until December 2021 when border closures and quarantine measures were removed, by which time community vaccination rates exceeded 95%. For CLL and MBL patients with impaired vaccine responses, we adopted an approach of measuring anti-spike antibody (Ab) response using multiple COVID vaccine doses to achieve the optimum individual response, which significantly increased seroconversion and anti-spike Ab levels [1,2]. We evaluated the effectiveness of this multiple vaccination strategy against severe COVID infection in CLL and MBL patients. Method(s): Medical and COVID history was assessed in routine consultations, questionnaire and medical records from January 2020 to April 2023 at Royal North Shore Hospital, and Sydney Adventist Hospital, Sydney, Australia with informed consent. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (quantitative) and anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibody (qualitative) levels were measured as previously reported (Abbott Diagnostics). Vaccination commenced in March 2020, and the first CLL patient developed COVID infection in December 2021. Result(s): In this study, there were 296 patients with CLL (241) and MBL (55) with up to 8 (median 4) vaccine doses included. COVID infection rates were 53.9% (129/241) in CLL and 40.0% (22/55) in MBL patients. 7 CLL patients had a second episode of infection. These rates of infection are significantly lower than the incidence of infection in the general Australian community (>90%), and those aged >65 years (>70%). Hospitalization was required in 8 (of 129) CLL patients (6.2%) with 1 death (0.8%) from beginning of the pandemic in January 2020 until April 2023. The duration of admission ranged from 3 to 8 weeks; none required ventilation or ICU admission. Three were on active CLL treatment (2 ibrutinib, 1 venetoclax), but did not correlate to higher risk of hospitalization. There was 1 COVID-related death (1/129, 0.8%) due to acute anuric renal failure at 4 weeks (with concurrently diagnosed refractory metastatic melanoma). No MBL patient was hospitalised or died. There were 61 (of 129, 47.3%) CLL patients treated with anti-viral therapy; 33 received nirmatrelvir + ritonavir (54.1%), 23 molnupiravir (37.7%), and 5 remdesivir (8.2%). Of the 8 hospitalized CLL patients, 5 received remdesivir only, 1 molnupiravir and 2 no anti-viral therapy. Of the total 23 COVID infected MBL patients, 15 (68.2%) received no medication and 7 (31.8%) received antiviral therapy; 4 nirmatrelvir + ritonavir (57.1%) and 3 molnupiravir (43.9%). Positive anti-spike levels (>50AU/mL) were documented in 90.6% CLL (106/117) and 100% MBL patients (20/20). The median anti-spike levels in CLL patients who developed COVID infection (3778.8 AU/mL) were significantly lower compared to those who, to date, have not (13486.8 AU/mL) (p = 0.0061) (Figure 1(A,B)). In MBL, there was no difference in anti-spike levels. CLL patients with low anti-spike levels and younger patients had a higher risk COVID infection (Figure 1(C,D)). Anti-nucleocapsid antibody (anti-NC Ab) post-COVID infection were detected in 12 of 48 CLL (25.0%) and 5 of 9 MBL (55.6%) within 2 months. Among patients followed >6 months, only 9 of 12 CLL patients (18.8% of 48) and 1 of 5 MBL patients (11.1% of 9) still had detectable anti-NC antibodies (Table 1). Hence, anti-NC Ab is not a reliable marker of COVID infection in CLL populations. Despite only 9 patients being administered T + C prior to COVID infection, these had a lower risk of infection (Figure 1(C,D)); 1 required hospitalization due to COVID 5 months after T + C (Figure 1(B)). The currently dominant Omicron XBB variants (NSW respiratory surveillance reports 2023), are now resistant to prophylactic T + C highlighting that the optimum stimulation of endogenous immune response remain very important. Conclusion(s): CLL and MBL patients have impaired immune response to vaccination, leading to slower and lower levels of anti-spike response. A multiple vaccine doses strategy to optimal response resulted in very low mortality (0.8%) and hospitalization rates (6.2%).

262,Oral Antiviral Treatment for COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review on Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir.,2022 11 17,"Despite the rapid development of efficient and safe vaccines against COVID-19, the need to confine the pandemic and treat infected individuals on an outpatient basis has led to the approval of oral antiviral agents. Taking into account the viral kinetic pattern of SARS-CoV-2, it is of high importance to intervene at the early stages of the disease. A protease inhibitor called nirmatrelvir coupled with ritonavir (NMV/r), which acts as a CYP3A inhibitor, delivered as an oral formulation, has shown much promise in preventing disease progression in high-risk patients with no need for supplemental oxygen administration. Real-world data seem to confirm the drug combination's efficacy and safety against all viral variants of concern in adult populations. Although, not fully clarified, viral rebound and recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms have been described following treatment; however, more data on potential resistance issues concerning the Mpro gene, which acts as the drug's therapeutic target, are needed.

37,Drug repurposing for respiratory infections,,"Respiratory infections such as Coronavirus disease 2019 are a substantial worldwide health challenge, frequently resulting in severe sickness and death, especially in susceptible groups. Conventional drug development for respiratory infections faces obstacles such as extended timescales, substantial expenses, and the rise of resistance to current treatments. Drug repurposing is a potential method that has evolved to quickly find and reuse existing medications for treating respiratory infections. Drug repurposing utilizes medications previously approved for different purposes, providing a cost-effective and time-efficient method to tackle pressing medical needs. This chapter summarizes current progress and obstacles in repurposing medications for respiratory infections, focusing on notable examples of repurposed pharmaceuticals and their probable modes of action. The text also explores the significance of computational approaches, high-throughput screening, and preclinical investigations in identifying potential candidates for repurposing. The text delves into the significance of regulatory factors, clinical trial structure, and actual data in confirming the effectiveness and safety of repurposed medications for respiratory infections. Drug repurposing is a valuable technique for quickly increasing the range of treatments for respiratory infections, leading to better patient outcomes and decreasing the worldwide disease burden.Copyright Â© 2024",Israr J.; Alam S.; kumar A.,,1877-1173,/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2024.03.033,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fbs.pmbts.2024.03.033,,,,82

93,Personalised pharmacovigilance advice in the prescription of paxlovid by a regional pharmacovigilance center (CRPV),,"Introduction: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID- 19. Due to complex drug-drug interactions primarily due to the ritonavir, the French network of CRPVs has mobilised to help health professionals. The objective of this work is to describe the personalised pharmacovigilance advice (PPA) related to paxlovid by our CRPV since October 2022. Material(s) and Method(s): All PPA concerning Paxlovid by the CRPV of Marseille until December 31st, 2022 are analysed. Result(s): We provided 23 PPA. Majority of PPA were preventive for collegial decision making. Checking for drug interactions between paxlovid and several pharmacological classes such as alpha blocker, anticoagulant, oral contraceptives, anti-aldosterone, antiplatelet, antimalarial, hypolipidemic, immunosuppressant, calcium channel blocker, antidepressant, cystic fibrosis treatment due to risk related to CYP3A4 and/or P-gp interaction. For other classes no interactions were expected or lack of data (analgesic, anti-asthma, antihistamine, antagonist interleukine, TNF-inhibitor, antibiotic, monoclonal antibody, antidiabetic, antiepileptic, antineoplastic, antiretroviral, antiviral, anxiolytic, betablocker, bisphosphonate, corticosteroid, diuretic, GABAergic, proton-pump inhibitor, incontinence treatment). PPA were based on the recommendations of French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (SFPT), and SPC. Others were about good use of Paxlovid as a dose adjustment in renal failure lung transplant patients. Some PPAs concerned the occurrence of adverse events such as lethargy with vomiting and severe hypotension in patient treated with tacrolimus without dosage modification, requiring support of our CRPV for medical management. No case required close therapeutic drug monitoring. A case concerned patients treated for cystic fibrosis requering recourse to international literature and FDA SPC because of absence of French information concerning a potential interaction between Paxlovid and CFTR modulator.

246,Nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted in female Syrian hamsters and retains partial susceptibility to treatment.,2023 04 14,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) is one of the promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir is the first 3CLpro inhibitor authorized for treatment of COVID-19 patients at high risk of hospitalization. We recently reported on the in vitro selection of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro resistant virus (L50F-E166A-L167F; 3CLprores) that is cross-resistant with nirmatrelvir and other 3CLpro inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that the 3CLprores virus replicates efficiently in the lungs of intranasally infected female Syrian hamsters and causes lung pathology comparable to that caused by the WT virus. Moreover, hamsters infected with 3CLprores virus transmit the virus efficiently to co-housed non-infected contact hamsters. Importantly, at a dose of 200 mg/kg (BID) of nirmatrelvir, the compound was still able to reduce the lung infectious virus titers of 3CLprores-infected hamsters by 1.4 log10 with a modest improvement in the lung histopathology as compared to the vehicle control. Fortunately, resistance to Nirmatrelvir does not readily develop in clinical setting. Yet, as we demonstrate, in case drug-resistant viruses emerge, they may spread easily which may thus impact therapeutic options. Therefore, the use of 3CLpro inhibitors in combination with other drugs may be considered, especially in immunodeficient patients, to avoid the development of drug-resistant viruses.

In the context of expanding the therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19, molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) were developed, constituting the first effective oral treatments against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this narrative review, we retrospectively inquired into the clinical trials and real-world studies investigating the efficacy of these agents. Overall, clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both agents in reducing hospitalization and death rates in COVID-19 patients. As per current recommendations, their use is suggested in patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are at high risk of developing severe disease. Nevertheless, limited data exist regarding their efficacy in specific subpopulations, such as immunocompromised patients, those with severe kidney disease, pregnant women, and children.Copyright Â© 2023 by the authors.",Karniadakis I.; Mazonakis N.; Tsioutis C.; Papadakis M.; Markaki I.; Spernovasilis N.,,2036-7449 (electronic),/10.3390/idr15060061,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3390%2fidr15060061,,,,87
98,Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir): A new approach to Covid-19 therapy?,,"Despite the need for novel, effective therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic, no curative regimen is yet available, therefore patients are forced to rely on supportive and nonspecific therapies. Some SARS-CoV-2 proteins, like the 3 C-like protease (3CLpro) or the major protease (Mpro), have been identified as promising targets for antiviral drugs. The Mpro has major a role in protein processing as well as pathogenesis of the virus, and could be a useful therapeutic target. The antiviral drug nirmatrelvir can keep SARS-CoV-2 from replicating through inhibiting Mpro. Nirmatrelvir was combined with another HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir, to create Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir). The metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3 A is inhibited by ritonavir to lengthen the half-life of nirmatrelvir, so rintonavir acts as a pharmacological enhancer. Nirmatrelvir exhibits potent antiviral activity against current coronavirus variants, despite significant alterations in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. Nevertheless, there are still several unanswered questions. This review summarizes the current literature on nirmatrelvir and ritonavir efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also their safety and possible side effects.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors",Hashemian S.M.R.; Sheida A.; Taghizadieh M.; Memar M.Y.; Hamblin M.R.; Bannazadeh Baghi H.; Sadri Nahand J.; Asemi Z.; Mirzaei H.,,0753-3322,/10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114367,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.biopha.2023.114367,,,,88

As one of the most immediately druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2, the main protease (Mpro) has been studied thoroughly. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances in structural studies of Mpro, which provide new knowledge about Mpro in terms of its biological function, structural characteristics, substrate specificity, and autocleavage process.

252,Targeting the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 with phytochemicals from Saudi medicinal plants: molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics investigations.,2023 11,"The new health crises caused by SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. First discovered in November 2021, the omicron variant is more transmissible and is able to evade the immune system better than other previously identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, leading to a spike in cases. Great efforts have been made to discover inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Main protease (Mpro) inhibitors are considered promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. The U.S. FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Nirmatrelvir is the first orally bioavailable inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. There is an urgent need to monitor the mutations and solve the problem of resistance, especially omicron Mpro, which contains one mutation - P132H. In the present study, 132,57 phytochemicals from 80 medicinal plants grown in Saudi Arabia were docked into the active site of Mpro omicron variant. Free binding energies were also calculated. This led to the discovery of five phytochemicals that showed better docking scores than the bound ligand nirmatrelvir. In addition, these molecules exhibited favorable free binding energies. The stability of compounds 1-5 with the protein was studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These compounds showed acceptable ADMET properties. The results were compared with the wild type. These candidates could be envisioned as new hits against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

158,A potential allosteric inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) identified through metastable state analysis.,2024,"Anti-COVID19 drugs, such as nirmatrelvir, have been developed targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro, based on the critical requirement of its proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins into functional proteins essential for viral replication. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with Mpro mutations has raised the possibility of developing resistance against these drugs, likely due to therapeutic targeting of the Mpro catalytic site. An alternative to these drugs is the development of drugs that target an allosteric site distant from the catalytic site in the protein that may reduce the chance of the emergence of resistant mutants. Here, we combine computational analysis with in vitro assay and report the discovery of a potential allosteric site and an allosteric inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Specifically, we identified an Mpro metastable state with a deformed catalytic site harboring potential allosteric sites, raising the possibility that stabilization of this metastable state through ligand binding can lead to the inhibition of Mpro activity. We then performed a computational screening of a library (~4.2 million) of drug-like compounds from the ZINC database and identified several candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity. MD simulations showed stable binding of the three top-ranking compounds to the putative allosteric sites in the protein. Finally, we tested the three compounds in vitro using a BRET-based Mpro biosensor and found that one of the compounds (ZINC4497834) inhibited the Mpro activity. We envisage that the identification of a potential allosteric inhibitor of Mpro will aid in developing improved anti-COVID-19 therapy.

116,"HIV and COVID-19 Co-Infection: Epidemiology, Clinical Characteristics, and Treatment",,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global medical emergency with a significant socio-economic impact. People with HIV (PWH), due to the underlying immunosuppression and the particularities of HIV stigma, are considered a vulnerable population at high risk. In this review, we report what is currently known in the available literature with regards to the clinical implications of the overlap of the two epidemics. PWH share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population (age, comorbidities), but virological and immunological status also plays an important role. Clinical presentation does not differ significantly, but there are some opportunistic infections that can mimic or co-exist with COVID-19. PWH should be prime candidates for preventative COVID-19 treatments when they are available, but in the setting of resistant strains, this might be not easy. When considering small-molecule medications, physicians need to always remember to address potential interactions with ART, and when considering immunosuppressants, they need to be aware of potential risks for opportunistic infections. COVID-19 shares similarities with HIV in how the public perceives patients-with fear of the unknown and prejudice. There are opportunities for HIV treatment hidden in COVID-19 research with the leaps gained in both monoclonal antibody and vaccine development.Copyright Â© 2023 by the authors.",Basoulis D.; Mastrogianni E.; Voutsinas P.-M.; Psichogiou M.,,1999-4915 (electronic),/10.3390/v15020577,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3390%2fv15020577,,,,93
154,Persistence of an infectious form of SARS-CoV-2 post protease inhibitor treatment of permissive cells in vitro.,2024 Aug 12,"Reports have described SARS-CoV-2 rebound in COVID-19 patients treated with nirmatrelvir, a 3CL protease inhibitor. The cause remains a mystery, although drug resistance, re-infection, and lack of adequate immune responses have been excluded. We now present virologic findings that provide a clue to the cause of viral rebound, which occurs in ~20% of the treated cases. Persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally documented in vitro after treatment with nirmatrelvir or another 3CL protease inhibitor, but not with a polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir. This infectious form decayed slowly with a half-life of ~1 day, suggesting that its persistence could outlive the treatment course to re-ignite SARS-CoV-2 infection as the drug is eliminated. Notably, extending nirmatrelvir treatment beyond 8 days abolished viral rebound in vitro. Our findings point in a particular direction for future investigation of virus persistence and offer a specific treatment recommendation that should be tested clinically.

118,Clinical implications of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease,,"People across the world are affected by the ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", brought on by the ""SARS-CoV type-2 coronavirus"". Due to its high incidence in individuals with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), COVID-19 has gained much attention. The metabolic syndrome's hepatic manifestation, MAFLD, carries a significant risk of type-2diabetes. The link between the above two conditions has also drawn increasing consideration since MAFLD is intricately linked to the obesity epidemic. Independent of the metabolic syndrome, MAFLD may impact the severity of the viral infections, including COVID-19 or may even be a risk factor. An important question is whether the present COVID-19 pandemic has been fueled by the obesity and MAFLD epidemics. Many liver markers are seen elevated in COVID-19. MAFLD patients with associated comorbid conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, malignancy, hypertension, and old age are prone to develop severe disease. There is an urgent need for more studies to determine the link between the two conditions and whether it might account for racial differences in the mortality and morbidity rates linked to COVID-19. The role of innate and adaptive immunity alterations in MAFLD patients may influence the severity of COVID-19. This review investigates the implications of COVID-19 on liver injury and disease severity and viceversa. We also addressed the severity of COVID-19 in patients with prior MAFLD and its potential implications and therapeutic administration in the clinical setting.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.

A RARE CASE OF HYPOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA PRESENTING AS DERMATOMYOSITIS FOLLOWING A COVID 19 INFECTION,,"CASE: A 73-year-old Vietnamese man with no medical history presented with facial swelling, dysphagia, proximal upper extremity weakness and a heliotrope rash two weeks following a COVID-19 infection treated with Paxlovid. An elevated CK was found. CT neck revealed a single cervical lymph node. COVID related or drug-induced dermatomyositis (DM) from Paxlovid was concluded. Improvement was noted on steroids and a short taper was prescribed. One month later, he returned with recurrence of symptoms following the completion of steroids. A deltoid muscle biopsy was performed revealing dermatomyositis with positive P155/P140 and TIF-1 gamma antibodies. Neck, chest, abdomen/pelvis CT showed an unchanged cervical lymph node, no other mass or lymphadenopathy. The cervical lymph node was biopsied, and the patient was sent home on another prednisone taper. Pathology returned as non-small cell carcinoma. PET scan revealed a mild hypermetabolic foci at the left piriform sinus. Several weeks later, the left piriform sinus was biopsied and sent for pathology which revealed squamous cell carcinoma. A partial laryngopharyngectomy was performed. Final pathology report revealed a poorly differentiated invasive basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Almost three months from presentation, he was referred for consideration of chemoradiation after surgery. His debilitation progressed during this time to the point of inability to perform ADLs or obtain adequate oral nutrition. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: DM has been reported as a possible sequela of COVID-19 infection and the side effect profile of Paxlovid is not fully understood to date. Though lymphadenopathy has been noted with COVID-19, it's important to remember that DM is associated with a 6-fold higher risk of malignancy. Head and neck cancer has been observed to be the predominant type in several areas of Asia. Myositis-specific antibodies, P155/P140 and TIF-1gamma/alpha antibodies are associated with malignancy. Our patient, a Vietnamese-born male was found to have head and neck cancer in the form of a rare hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma causing his DM. This case was complicated by the timing of his COVID-infection and Paxlovid treatment which incorrectly led to a diagnosis of drug-induced DM. CONCLUSION(S): As we are learning about post-COVID conditions and monitoring the side of effects of Paxlovid, we must continue to be cognizant of other etiologies for illnesses that occur near a COVID infection. Though DM has been associated with COVID, refractory symptoms after steroids should warrant prompt investigation for malignancy. Although lymphadenopathy is common with COVID infection, in certain clinical settings as DM, prompt biopsy may expedite a diagnosis and treatment of malignancy, possibly shortening debilitating symptoms and allowing for quicker return of function.",Tran A.D.; Baker J.,,1525-1497,/10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1007%2fs11606-023-08226-z,,,,97

Ongoing researches are focused on developing and manufacturing standard treatment strategies and effective vaccines to control the pandemic. Despite developing several vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other vaccines in phase 4 clinical trials, preventive measures are mandatory to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

106,COVID-19 pre-exposure prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab in patients with haematological malignancy: A single-centre experience,,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic still pose a substantial threat worldwide despite increasing vaccine availability. Patients with haematological malignancies have been shown to have increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and are more susceptible to develop severe illness from SARS-CoV- 2 infection. The immune response to vaccines is impaired in patients with haematological malignancy due to underlying disease or antineoplastic therapies. The monoclonal-antibody combination, Evusheld is composed of tixagevimab and cilgavimab, two neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV- 2. It has been shown to be safe and have efficacy for the prevention of COVID-19. Our aim of study is to describe the incidence and outcome of breakthrough COVID-19 infection among patients who received Evusheld in our centre and analyse the factors that possibly increase the risk of breakthrough infection. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of all adult patients with haematological malignancy who received tixagevimab/ cilgavimab 150/150 mg injection in Hospital Pulau Pinang from 1 July 2022 to 31 August 2022 with a follow-up period to 30 November 2022 was conducted. Demographic data, clinical characteristics and outcome will be retrieved from patient's medical records. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (version 21.0). Result(s): A total of 96 patients (50 males and 46 females) received tixagevimab/cilgavimab injection during the study period with a median age of 61 years (range 19-82). Majority of them were diagnosed with multiple myeloma (42.7%), followed by lymphoma (33.3%) and leukaemia (24%). One third of them had history of therapy with monoclonal antibody and 20% had haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No major adverse effects of tixagevimab/cilgavimab injection were noted among the study population. Of the 12 patients (12.5%) who had COVID-19 infection, all of them had mild infection; three were asymptomatic and six patients received Paxlovid antiviral therapy. The median time from tixagevimab/cilgavimab to the onset of COVID-19 infection was 35 days (range 5-97 days). The mean age of patients with breakthrough COVID-19 infection were older compared to those without breakthrough infection but was not statistically significant. The incidence of breakthrough COVID-19 infection was not affected by type of haematological malignancy, history of monoclonal antibody therapy or COVID-19 vaccination. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Our findings showed that tixagevimab/cilgavimab was safe and effective in preventing COVID-19- related morbidity and mortality among patients with haematological malignancy during the study period. However, the limitation is the lack of access to whole genome sequencing for detection of resistant variants for breakthrough infections.",Lee K.T.; Low W.C.; Tan S.K.; Chiang S.K.; Chew T.K.; Goh A.S.,,1365-2141,/10.1111/bjh.18721,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1111%2fbjh.18721,,,,101
33,Targeting stress induction of GRP78 by cardiac glycoside oleandrin dually suppresses cancer and COVID-19,,"Background: Despite recent therapeutic advances, combating cancer resistance remains a formidable challenge. The 78-kilodalton glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a key stress-inducible endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, plays a crucial role in both cancer cell survival and stress adaptation. GRP78 is also upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and acts as a critical host factor. Recently, we discovered cardiac glycosides (CGs) as novel suppressors of GRP78 stress induction through a high-throughput screen of clinically relevant compound libraries. This study aims to test the possibility that agents capable of blocking stress induction of GRP78 could dually suppress cancer and COVID-19. Result(s): Here we report that oleandrin (OLN), is the most potent among the CGs in inhibiting acute stress induction of total GRP78, which also results in reduced cell surface and nuclear forms of GRP78 in stressed cells. The inhibition of stress induction of GRP78 is at the post-transcriptional level, independent of protein degradation and autophagy and may involve translational control as OLN blocks stress-induced loading of ribosomes onto GRP78 mRNAs. Moreover, the human Na+/K+-ATPase alpha3 isoform is critical for OLN suppression of GRP78 stress induction. OLN, in nanomolar range, enhances apoptosis, sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, and reduces the viability of patient-derived colon cancer organoids. Likewise, OLN, suppresses GRP78 expression and impedes tumor growth in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model. Furthermore, OLN blocks infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants and enhances existing anti-viral therapies. Notably, GRP78 overexpression mitigates OLN-mediated cancer cell apoptotic onset and suppression of virus release. Conclusion(s): Our findings validate GRP78 as a target of OLN anti-cancer and anti-viral activities. These proof-of-principle studies support further investigation of OLN as a readily accessible compound to dually combat cancer and COVID-19.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2024.",Ha D.P.; Shin W.-J.; Liu Z.; Doche M.E.; Lau R.; Leli N.M.; Conn C.S.; Russo M.; Lorenzato A.; Koumenis C.; Yu M.; Mumenthaler S.M.; Lee A.S.,,2045-3701 (electronic),/10.1186/s13578-024-01297-3,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1186%2fs13578-024-01297-3,,,,102
0,Change in the kinetics of sulphacetamide tissue distribution in Walker tumor-bearing rats.,1975,"The effect of Walker tumor on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg. After oral administration of sulphacetamide (5 and 20 min), the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumor-bearing rats when compared with that of control group. However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals. It is concluded that, in Walker tumor-bearing rats, there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug.","Nadeau, D; Marchand, C",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,0090-9556,,1234,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1234,,,,103

7,Dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations identify allosteric sites and positions associated with drug resistance in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) plays an essential role in the coronavirus lifecycle by catalysing hydrolysis of the viral polyproteins at specific sites. Mpro is the target of drugs, such as nirmatrelvir, though resistant mutants have emerged that threaten drug efficacy. Despite its importance, questions remain on the mechanism of how Mpro binds its substrates. Here, we apply dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to evaluate structural and dynamical responses of Mpro to the presence and absence of a substrate. The results highlight communication between the Mpro dimer subunits and identify networks, including some far from the active site, that link the active site with a known allosteric inhibition site, or which are associated with nirmatrelvir resistance. They imply that some mutations enable resistance by altering the allosteric behaviour of Mpro. More generally, the results show the utility of the D-NEMD technique for identifying functionally relevant allosteric sites and networks including those relevant to resistance.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

198,COVID-19 and Pregnancy: Interrelationships With Asthma and Allergy.,2023 12,"Pregnant individuals are at higher risk of complications from respiratory viruses such as coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). Altered lung function, vaccine hesitancy, and resistance to taking necessary medications because of a lack of safety data in pregnancy make this population especially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. Like many medical conditions, the treatment of allergic conditions, including asthma and allergic rhinitis, were affected during the pandemic, with decreased numbers of in-person visits and interruptions in medical treatment. There were initially no data to allow pregnant women with asthma know whether the condition put them at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. There are now increasing data for the efficacy and safety of vaccines for COVID-19 in at-risk populations, including pregnant women. Vaccine studies show no increased risk for spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, or pregnancy complications. Furthermore, infants of individuals vaccinated during pregnancy have been shown to obtain protective antibodies via the placenta, providing protection against COVID-19 after birth. Although overall risks are low, pregnant women who become infected with COVID-19 are at higher risk for maternal and pregnancy complications. Antiviral treatment is available for pregnant women with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19, with reassuring safety data to date. Dexamethasone is the mainstay of inpatient therapy.

232,"The history, mechanism, and perspectives of nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332): an orally bioavailable main protease inhibitor used in combination with ritonavir to reduce COVID-19-related hospitalizations.",2022,"The rapid development of effective vaccines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been an effective counter measure to decrease hospitalization and the mortality rate in many countries. However, with the risk of mutated strains decreasing the efficacy of the vaccine, there has been an increasing demand for antivirals to treat COVID-19. While antivirals, such as remdesivir, have had some success treating COVID-19 patients in hospital settings, there is a need for orally bioavailable, cost-effective antivirals that can be administered in outpatient settings to minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is an orally bioavailable Mpro (also called 3CLpro) inhibitor developed by Pfizer. It is administered in combination with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that decreases the metabolism of nirmatrelvir. This review seeks to outline the history of the rational design, the target selectivity, synthesis, drug resistance, and future perspectives of nirmatrelvir. Graphical abstract.

67,Mitigating COVID-19 Mortality and Morbidity in China's Aging Population: A Focus on Available Medications and Future Developments,,"The COVID-19 pandemic, often referred to as the geropandemic, has put immense pressure on global healthcare systems worldwide, leading to a rush in the development and approval of medications for the treatment of the viral infection. Clinical trials on efficacy and safety had a limited spectrum on inclusion and endpoints because of the urgent need for fast results. The chronologically and biologically aged population is especially at risk for severe or lethal disease, as well as treatment-associated toxicity. In China, the growing elderly population segment has been a focus in public health measurements of COVID-19, guiding towards herd immunity with a mild variant, thus minimizing overall deaths and morbidity. While the COVID-19 pandemic has now been reclassified and the virus weakened, there is a clear need for novel therapies to protect the elderly. This paper reviews the current safety and efficacy of available COVID-19 medications in China, with a specific focus on 3CL protease inhibitors and the aging population. The current COVID wave in China has demonstrated a significant impact on the elderly and the need for new drugs that are effective at low doses and can be used alone, without harmful side effects, generation of viral resistance, and drug-drug interactions. The rush to develop and approve COVID-19 medications has brought up important questions about the balance between speed and caution, resulting in a pipeline of novel therapies now moving through clinical trials, including third-generation 3CL protease inhibitors. A majority of those therapeutics are being developed in China.Copyright Â© 2023 Bischof E.",Bischof E.,,2152-5250 (electronic),/10.14336/AD.2023.0318,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.14336%2fAD.2023.0318,,,,109
271,IDentif.AI-Omicron: Harnessing an AI-Derived and Disease-Agnostic Platform to Pinpoint Combinatorial Therapies for Clinically Actionable Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Intervention.,2022 09 27,"Nanomedicine-based and unmodified drug interventions to address COVID-19 have evolved over the course of the pandemic as more information is gleaned and virus variants continue to emerge. For example, some early therapies (e.g., antibodies) have experienced markedly decreased efficacy. Due to a growing concern of future drug resistant variants, current drug development strategies are seeking to find effective drug combinations. In this study, we used IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence-derived platform, to investigate the drug-drug and drug-dose interaction space of six promising experimental or currently deployed therapies at various concentrations: EIDD-1931, YH-53, nirmatrelvir, AT-511, favipiravir, and auranofin. The drugs were tested in vitro against a live B.1.1.529 (Omicron) virus first in monotherapy and then in 50 strategic combinations designed to interrogate the interaction space of 729 possible combinations. Key findings and interactions were then further explored and validated in an additional experimental round using an expanded concentration range. Overall, we found that few of the tested drugs showed moderate efficacy as monotherapies in the actionable concentration range, but combinatorial drug testing revealed significant dose-dependent drug-drug interactions, specifically between EIDD-1931 and YH-53, as well as nirmatrelvir and YH-53. Checkerboard validation analysis confirmed these synergistic interactions and also identified an interaction between EIDD-1931 and favipiravir in an expanded range. Based on the platform nature of IDentif.AI, these findings may support further explorations of the dose-dependent drug interactions between different drug classes in further pre-clinical and clinical trials as possible combinatorial therapies consisting of unmodified and nanomedicine-enabled drugs, to combat current and future COVID-19 strains and other emerging pathogens.",Blasiak A; Truong ATL; Wang P; Hooi L; Chye H; Tan SB; You K; Remus A; Allen DM; Chai LYA; Chan CEZ; Lye DCB; Tan GG; Seah SGK; Chow EK; Ho D,,,/10.1021/acsnano.2c06366,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.1021%2facsnano.2c06366,,,,110
139,First-generation oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2,,"Background: Oral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have received emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients who are at high risk for clinical progression. Objective(s): To provide a clinical practice overview of first-generation oral antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. Sources: References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, bioRxiv, medRxiv, regulatory drug agencies, and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 16 February 2022. Content: Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir and ritonavir have been authorized for use in nonhospitalized individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression. In clinical trials, molnupiravir reduced the frequency of hospitalization or death by 3% (relative risk reduction 30%), and nirmatrelvir and ritonavir by 6% (relative risk reduction 89%). Their use in clinical practice requires early administration, review of drug-drug interactions (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), considerations of embryo-fetal toxicity (molnupiravir), and compliance with ingestion of a high number of pills. Knowledge gaps include the efficacy of these agents in vaccinated, hospitalized, or immunosuppressed individuals with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 persistence.

However, our current understanding of its tolerance to mutations is limited. Here, we develop a yeast-based deep mutational scanning approach to systematically profile the activity of all possible single mutants of the 3CLpro and validate a subset of our results within authentic viruses. We reveal that the 3CLpro is highly malleable and is capable of tolerating mutations throughout the protein. Yet, we also identify specific residues that appear immutable, suggesting that these may be targets for future 3CLpro inhibitors. Finally, we utilize our screening as a basis to identify E166V as a resistance-conferring mutation against the clinically used 3CLpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir. Collectively, the functional map presented herein may serve as a guide to better understand the biological properties of the 3CLpro and for drug development against coronaviruses.

135,New Perspectives on Antimicrobial Agents: Molnupiravir and Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir for Treatment of COVID-19,,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to cause pandemic respiratory disease in the past 2 years, leading to significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. At the beginning of the pandemic, only nonspecific treatments were available, but recently two oral antivirals have received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Molnupiravir targets the viral polymerase and causes lethal mutations within the virus during replication. Nirmatrelvir targets SARS-CoV-2's main protease, and it is combined with ritonavir to delay its metabolism and allow nirmatrelvir to inhibit proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins during replication, preventing efficient virus production. Both drugs inhibit in vitro viral replication of all variants tested to date. Each is taken orally twice daily for 5 days. When started in the first 5 days of illness in persons at risk for complications due to COVID-19, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly decreased severe outcomes (hospitalizations and death) with adjusted relative risk reductions of 30% and 88%, respectively, for the two treatments. Molnupiravir should not be used in children or pregnant persons due to concerns about potential toxicity, and reliable contraception should be used in persons of childbearing potential. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may cause significant drug-to-drug interactions that limit its use in persons taking certain medications metabolized by certain cytochrome P450 enzymes. Both treatment regimens are important additions to the management of early COVID-19 in at-risk patients in the outpatient setting.Copyright Â© 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

131,Challenges of rapamycin repurposing as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19: implications for skeletal muscle metabolic health in older persons,,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has spread worldwide, resulting in over 6 million deaths as of March 2022. Older people have been disproportionately affected by the disease, as they have a greater risk of hospitalization, are more vulnerable to severe infection, and have higher mortality than younger patients. Although effective vaccines have been rapidly developed and administered globally, several clinical trials are ongoing to repurpose existing drugs to combat severe infection. One such drug, rapamycin, is currently under study for this purpose, given its immunosuppressant effects that are mediated by its inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of cell growth. Consistent with this premise, acute rapamycin administration in young healthy humans blocks or attenuates mTOR and its downstream effectors, leading to the inhibition of muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Skeletal muscle mass declines when MPS is chronically lower than muscle protein breakdown. This is consequential for older people who are more susceptible to anabolic resistance (i.e., the blunting of MPS) due to reduced activity, sedentariness, or bed rest such as that associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, and who have also demonstrated a delayed or blunted ability to regain inactivity-induced muscle loss. The lack of studies investigating rapamycin administration on skeletal muscle in older people, and the emergence of effective antiviral medications against severe infection, may indicate the reduced relevance of drug repurposing for present or future pandemics.Copyright Â© 2022 American Physiological Society.

250,"The Substitutions L50F, E166A, and L167F in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Are Selected by a Protease Inhibitor In Vitro and Confer Resistance To Nirmatrelvir.",2023 02 28,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) has an indispensable role in the viral life cycle and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. The potential of 3CLpro-inhibitors to select for drug-resistant variants needs to be established. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161, a probe compound designed in the context of a 3CLpro drug discovery program. We identified a combination of amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) that is associated with a >20x increase in 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir. While two of the single substitutions (E166A and L167F) provide low-level resistance to the inhibitors in a biochemical assay, the triple mutant results in the highest levels of resistance (6x to 72x). All substitutions are associated with a significant loss of enzymatic 3CLpro activity, suggesting a reduction in viral fitness. Structural biology analysis indicates that the different substitutions reduce the number of inhibitor/enzyme interactions while the binding of the substrate is maintained. These observations will be important for the interpretation of resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors in the clinical setting. IMPORTANCE Paxlovid is the first oral antiviral approved for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antiviral treatments are often associated with the development of drug-resistant viruses. In order to guide the use of novel antivirals, it is essential to understand the risk of resistance development and to characterize the associated changes in the viral genes and proteins. In this work, we describe for the first time a pathway that allows SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance against Paxlovid in vitro. The characteristics of in vitro antiviral resistance development may be predictive for the clinical situation. Therefore, our work will be important for the management of COVID-19 with Paxlovid and next-generation SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.",Jochmans D; Liu C; Donckers K; Stoycheva A; Boland S; Stevens SK; De Vita C; Vanmechelen B; Maes P; Trueb B; Ebert N; Thiel V; De Jonghe S; Vangeel L; Bardiot D; Jekle A; Blatt LM; Beigelman L; Symons JA; Raboisson P; Chaltin P; Marchand A; Neyts J; Deval J; Vandyck K,,,/10.1128/mbio.02815-22,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med23&DO=10.1128%2fmbio.02815-22,,,,116
64,ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS OF A NOVEL NANOEMULSION FORMULATION OF NIRMATRELVIR FOR A NASAL DELIVERY ON CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN HUMAN NASAL EPITHELIUM,,"Background During COVID19 pandemic, a small molecule antiviral agent PAXLOVIDTM was authorised for emergency use. The main antiviral component is nirmatrelvir, a coronavirus MPRO inhibitor, but it was combined with ritonavir to achieve persistent cell exposure. Respiratory virus usually infects through the nose and intranasal treatment is an attractive option for prophylactic treatment but challenging. Therefore, alternate strategies to deliver and retain nirmatrelvir within a treated cell is of great importance. Aim The aim of this project is to investigate antiviral effects of nirmatrelvir in a novel nanoemulsion formulation on coronavirus infected human primary nasal epithelium. Method Seasonal coronavirus (HCOV-229E) was inoculated to the apical surface of air liquid interface (ALI) cultured human primary nasal epithelium. Viral load in apical wash was determined by a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and RT-PCR. Cell integrity, a marker of cell damage by virus infection, was measured as a transmembrane electrical resistance (TEER). 50 muL of nirmatrelvir (0.1 mM) prepared in water or as a nanoemulsion was applied to apical surface of ALI nasal epithelium for 10 min, and virus inoculum (0.2 MOI) was then applied to apical surface on top of the treatment for 1 hr. Apical surface wash with media was collected after treatment, then 1, 2 and 3 days post virus inoculation. Results HCoV viral load was maximal at Day 1 post inoculation. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) of viral load for 3 days post inoculation revealed that nirmatrelvir in water, nanoemulsion alone, and nirmatrelvir in nanoemulsion showed 69.5%, 89.8% and 100% inhibition of viral load vs. control, respectively. RT-PCR AUC was also inhibited by 13.5%, 52.2% and 100%, respectively, suggesting nirmatrelvir and nanoemulsion component showed synergistic effects. The nirmatrelvir in nanoemulsion also protected from virus induced reduction of TEER. The nirmatrelvir in nanoemulsion was well tolerated and not cytotoxic.

230,Recent changes in the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease substantiate the danger of emerging resistance to antiviral drugs.,2022,"Introduction: The current coronavirus pandemic is being combated worldwide by nontherapeutic measures and massive vaccination programs. Nevertheless, therapeutic options such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main-protease (Mpro) inhibitors are essential due to the ongoing evolution toward escape from natural or induced immunity. While antiviral strategies are vulnerable to the effects of viral mutation, the relatively conserved Mpro makes an attractive drug target: Nirmatrelvir, an antiviral targeting its active site, has been authorized for conditional or emergency use in several countries since December 2021, and a number of other inhibitors are under clinical evaluation. We analyzed recent SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, since early detection of potential resistances supports a timely counteraction in drug development and deployment, and discovered accelerated mutational dynamics of Mpro since early December 2021.",Parigger L; Krassnigg A; Schopper T; Singh A; Tappler K; Kochl K; Hetmann M; Gruber K; Steinkellner G; Gruber CC,,2296-858X,/10.3389/fmed.2022.1061142,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm7&DO=10.3389%2ffmed.2022.1061142,,,,119
55,Sotrovimab: A Review of Its Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Variants,,"Among the anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the S-309 derivative sotrovimab was the most successful in having the longest temporal window of clinical use, showing a high degree of resiliency to SARS-CoV-2 evolution interrupted only by the appearance of the BA.2.86* variant of interest (VOI). This success undoubtedly reflects rational selection to target a highly conserved epitope in coronavirus Spike proteins. We review here the efficacy of sotrovimab against different SARS-CoV-2 variants in outpatients and inpatients, discussing both randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence. Although it could not be anticipated at the time of its development and introduction, sotrovimab's use in immunocompromised individuals who harbor large populations of variant viruses created the conditions for its eventual demise, as antibody selection and viral evolution led to its eventual withdrawal due to inefficacy against later variant lineages. Despite this, based on observational and real-world data, some authorities have continued to promote the use of sotrovimab, but the lack of binding to newer variants strongly argues for the futility of continued use. The story of sotrovimab highlights the power of modern biomedical science to generate novel therapeutics while also providing a cautionary tale for the need to devise strategies to minimize the emergence of resistance to antibody-based therapeutics.Copyright Â© 2024 by the authors.",Focosi D.; Casadevall A.; Franchini M.; Maggi F.,,1999-4915 (electronic),/10.3390/v16020217,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3390%2fv16020217,,,,120
13,Nirmatrelvir Resistance in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron_BA.1 and WA1 Replicons and Escape Strategies,,"The antiviral component of Paxlovid, nirmatrelvir (NIR), forms a covalent bond with Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5. To explore NIR resistance we designed mutations to impair binding of NIR over substrate. Using 12 Omicron (BA.1) and WA.1 SARS-CoV-2 replicons, cell-based complementation and enzymatic assays, we showed that in both strains, E166V imparted high NIR resistance (~55-fold), with major decrease in WA1 replicon fitness (~20-fold), but not BA.1 (~2-fold). WA1 replicon fitness was restored by L50F. These differences may contribute to a potentially lower barrier to resistance in Omicron than WA1. E166V is rare in untreated patients, albeit more prevalent in paxlovid-treated EPIC-HR clinical trial patients. Importantly, NIR-resistant replicons with E166V or E166V/L50F remained susceptible to a) the flexible GC376, and b) PF-00835231, which forms additional interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show steric clashes between the rigid and bulky NIR t-butyl and beta-branched V166 distancing the NIR warhead from its Cys145 target. In contrast, GC376, through ""wiggling and jiggling"" accommodates V166 and still covalently binds Cys145. PF-00835231 uses its strategically positioned methoxy-indole to form a beta-sheet and overcome E166V. Drug design based on strategic flexibility and main chain-targeting may help develop second-generation nsp5-targeting antivirals efficient against NIR-resistant viruses.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

169,Persistence of an infectious form of SARS-CoV-2 post protease inhibitor treatment of permissive cells in vitro.,2023 Dec 21,"Reports have described SARS-CoV-2 rebound in COVID-19 patients treated with nirmatrelvir, a 3CL protease inhibitor. The cause remains a mystery, although drug resistance, re-infection, and lack of adequate immune responses have been excluded. We now present virologic findings that provide a clue to the cause of viral rebound, which occurs in ~20% of the treated cases. The persistence of an intermediary form of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally documented in vitro after treatment with nirmatrelvir or another 3CL protease inhibitor, but not with a polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir. This infectious intermediate decayed slowly with a half-life of ~1 day, suggesting that its persistence could outlive the treatment course to re-ignited SARS-CoV-2 infection as the drug is eliminated. Additional studies are needed to define the nature of this viral intermediate, but our findings point to a particular direction for future investigation and offer a specific treatment recommendation that should be tested clinically.",Nair MS; Luck MI; Huang Y; Sabo Y; Ho DD,,,/10.1101/2023.12.20.572655,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm&DO=10.1101%2f2023.12.20.572655,,,,122
91,Accelerating antiviral drug discovery: lessons from COVID-19,,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a wave of rapid and collaborative drug discovery efforts took place in academia and industry, culminating in several therapeutics being discovered, approved and deployed in a 2-year time frame. This article summarizes the collective experience of several pharmaceutical companies and academic collaborations that were active in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral discovery. We outline our opinions and experiences on key stages in the small-molecule drug discovery process: target selection, medicinal chemistry, antiviral assays, animal efficacy and attempts to pre-empt resistance. We propose strategies that could accelerate future efforts and argue that a key bottleneck is the lack of quality chemical probes around understudied viral targets, which would serve as a starting point for drug discovery. Considering the small size of the viral proteome, comprehensively building an arsenal of probes for proteins in viruses of pandemic concern is a worthwhile and tractable challenge for the community.Copyright Â© 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",von Delft A.; Hall M.D.; Kwong A.D.; Purcell L.A.; Saikatendu K.S.; Schmitz U.; Tallarico J.A.; Lee A.A.,,1474-1776,/10.1038/s41573-023-00692-8,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1038%2fs41573-023-00692-8,,,,123
75,Outcomes of Oral Antiviral Therapy Compared to Monoclonal Antibody Against SARS-CoV-2 and Vaccination in Kidney Transplant Recipients with COVID-19,,"Purpose: Solid organ transplant recipients are at high risk of morbidity/mortality from coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Studies suggest that oral antiviral (AV) treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is effective however there is limited data comparing outcomes to those with monoclonal antibody (MAB) treatment. Herein, we report our single center experience comparing the use of oral AV vs MAB for COVID-19 treatment in kidney transplant recipients(KTRs). Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of all KTRs who developed COVID- 19 from 7/2020 to Feb 2023 at our center. Date of diagnosis, vaccine status, oral AV vs MAB treatment, hospitalization including length of stay and patient outcome was reviewed. Calculations utilized a fishers exact test with a significance level of 0.05. Result(s): 369 KTRs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the period reviewed. 219 (53%) KTRs received MAB treatment. 30 (8.1%) were treated with oral antiviral therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir n=14, molnupiravir = 16). There was a trend toward longer interval from diagnosis to treatment in patients who received molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Fig 1) Hospitalization was significantly lower in those receiving oral AV than those not treated (3.3% vs 33.3%, p=0.017, Fig 2a). Oral AV protects equally against hospitalization compared to MAB (3.3% vs 8%, p=0.703, Fig 2b). In vaccinated patients, oral AV protects equally against death compared to MAB (0% vs 0%, p value not able to calculate, Fig 2c). Conclusion(s): Early data suggests that outcomes with use of oral antiviral therapy is no different than those with MAB when treating kidney transplant recipients. While oral antiviral regimens have more medication interactions than MAB, the emergence of resistant strains over time has limited the use of MAB. Oral antiviral therapies may be an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections in the kidney transplant population. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

152,Miniaturized Modular Click Chemistry-enabled Rapid Discovery of Unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Inhibitors With Robust Potency and Drug-like Profile.,2024 Sep 25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has required an expeditious advancement of innovative antiviral drugs. In this study, focused compound libraries are synthesized in 96- well plates utilizing modular click chemistry to rapidly discover potent inhibitors targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent direct biological screening identifies novel 1,2,3-triazole derivatives as robust Mpro inhibitors with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Notably, C5N17B demonstrates sub-micromolar Mpro inhibitory potency (IC50 = 0.12 microM) and excellent antiviral activity in Calu-3 cells determined in an immunofluorescence-based antiviral assay (EC50 = 0.078 microM, no cytotoxicity: CC50 > 100 microM). C5N17B shows superior potency to nirmatrelvir (EC50 = 1.95 microM) and similar efficacy to ensitrelvir (EC50 = 0.11 microM). Importantly, this compound displays high antiviral activities against several SARS-CoV-2 variants (Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, EC50 = 0.13 - 0.26 microM) and HCoV-OC43, indicating its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. It is worthy that C5N17B retains antiviral activity against nirmatrelvir-resistant strains with T21I/E166V and L50F/E166V mutations in Mpro (EC50 = 0.26 and 0.15 microM, respectively). Furthermore, C5N17B displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Crystallography studies reveal a unique, non-covalent multi-site binding mode. In conclusion, these findings substantiate the potential of C5N17B as an up-and-coming drug candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for clinical therapy. Copyright Â© 2024 The Author(s).

109,MECHANISM AND RESISTANCE STUDIES OF SARS-CoV-2 MPRO INHIBITOR POMOTRELVIR (PBI-0451),,"Background: The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants underscores the need for broadly active inhibitors with a high barrier to resistance. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an essential viral enzyme required for viral polyprotein processing and is highly conserved across human coronaviruses. Pomotrelvir (PBI-0451) is a novel Mpro inhibitor currently completing phase 2 clinical trial. Here we describe the mechanism of action, broad activity against SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, combination studies with other SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and favorable resistance profile of pomotrelvir. Method(s): The kinetic parameters of pomotrelvir Mpro inhibition and its interaction with nirmaltrevir were determined in a kinetic protease assay. The IC50s of pomotrelvir on mutant Mpro proteins were measured in an endpoint Mpro assay. Combination studies of pomotrelvir with remdesivir and molnupiravir were carried out in A549-hACE2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 NLuc virus. Activity against SARS-CoV-2 clinical variants was assessed by infection of A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells followed by immunostaining of the viral nucleocapsid protein. Result(s): Pomotrelvir is a potent competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Ki =2.7 nM). Binding of pomotrelvir and the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir to the active site is mutually exclusive. In the SARS-CoV-2 NLuc assay, pomotrelvir is additive when combined with remdesivir or molnupiravir, two nucleoside analogs targeting viral RNA synthesis. When the effect of Mpro substitutions previously selected in a resistance study of pomotrelvir were analyzed in an enzyme assay, only Mpro-N133H showed a significant increase in IC50 (45-fold). The catalytic efficiency of Mpro-N133H is reduced by 10-fold and the recombinant virus SARSCoV-2 (WA1) -N133H is not viable, suggesting that N133H has lower replicative fitness. Lastly, pomotrelvir exhibits broad activity against all SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates tested to date, including five omicron variants. Conclusion(s): PBI-0451 is a potent competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and is broadly active against SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates including omicron variants. Results from inhibitor interaction studies support the potential combination of pomotrelvir with remdesivir and molnupiravir but not nirmatrelvir. Enzymatic characterization of in vitro selected pomotrelvir resistant variants indicates they either confer no resistance or have reduced fitness.",Tong X.; Stevens L.; Keung W.; Arnold L.; Lopatin U.; Denison M.; Kwong A.,,2161-5853,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641190127,,,,126
199,Antiviral therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2024 Jan,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reached a turning point. The non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing COVID-19 are lifting. Vaccination uptake is increasing in general, but this strategy is continuously challenged by the rapid evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Of note, the Omicron subvariants spread globally for at least one year, and the most recently developed subvariants show strong immune evasion to preexisting immunity, either from previous infection, vaccination or both. Therefore, early and appropriate antiviral agents to treat patients at risk for severe COVID-19 or death is crucial to decrease morbidities and mortalities, to restore the healthcare capacities and to facilitate a return to the new normal. Current antiviral therapy for COVID-19 consist of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and direct antiviral agents. Each agent has been proved for early ambulatory treatment of COIVD-19, but suffer from variable effectiveness and limitations due to patients' comorbidities, drug properties, or antiviral resistance. Besides, some specific mAbs are indicated for prophylaxis of COVID-19 before or after close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. This review article summarizes the evidence and unmet needs of the currently available antiviral agents for management of COVID-19 in the context of the Omicron subvariants.

216,Anthracyclines inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2023 09,"Vaccines and drugs are two effective medical interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, remdesivir, paxlovid, and molnupiravir, have been approved for treating COVID-19 patients, but more are needed, because each drug has its limitation of usage and SARS-CoV-2 constantly develops drug resistance mutations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 drugs have the potential to be repurposed to inhibit new human coronaviruses, thus help to prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks. We have screened a library of microbial metabolites to discover new SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To facilitate this screening effort, we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant carrying the nano luciferase as a reporter for measuring viral infection. Six compounds were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) below 1 muM, including the anthracycline drug aclarubicin that markedly reduced viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-mediated gene expression, whereas other anthracyclines inhibited SARS-CoV-2 by activating the expression of interferon and antiviral genes. As the most commonly prescribed anti-cancer drugs, anthracyclines hold the promise of becoming new SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

226,Recent Advances in Covalent Drug Discovery.,2023 Apr 28,"In spite of the increasing number of biologics license applications, the development of covalent inhibitors is still a growing field within drug discovery. The successful approval of some covalent protein kinase inhibitors, such as ibrutinib (BTK covalent inhibitor) and dacomitinib (EGFR covalent inhibitor), and the very recent discovery of covalent inhibitors for viral proteases, such as boceprevir, narlaprevir, and nirmatrelvir, represent a new milestone in covalent drug development. Generally, the formation of covalent bonds that target proteins can offer drugs diverse advantages in terms of target selectivity, drug resistance, and administration concentration. The most important factor for covalent inhibitors is the electrophile (warhead), which dictates selectivity, reactivity, and the type of protein binding (i.e., reversible or irreversible) and can be modified/optimized through rational designs. Furthermore, covalent inhibitors are becoming more and more common in proteolysis, targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for degrading proteins, including those that are currently considered to be 'undruggable'. The aim of this review is to highlight the current state of covalent inhibitor development, including a short historical overview and some examples of applications of PROTAC technologies and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Schaefer D; Cheng X,,1424-8247,/10.3390/ph16050663,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm8&DO=10.3390%2fph16050663,,,,129
204,Applications of peptide-functionalized or unfunctionalized selenium nanoparticles for the passivation of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).,2024 Jan,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA. 5 and XBB are currently causing a COVID resurgence due to their increased spreading and infectivity. These latest subvariants have been shown to be somewhat resistant to the most common vaccines even with the third dose. Moreover, it has been well documented that when patients stop taking some commercial therapies (such as Paxlovid), COVID from these variants may return and may even be more contagious. Herein, we tested unfunctionalized and functionalized selenium (Se) nanoparticles with three novel peptides (NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK, NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK, and NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK) previously shown by themselves to passivate the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 BA.4, BA.5 and XBB variants. Se is a natural element in our diet and is well known to boost the immune system, thus, providing a complementary approach to viral infections. NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed a stronger inhibition ability at 98 % for Omicron BA.4 % and 96 % for Omicron BA.5 after just 15 min in vitro. Two types of Se nanoparticles (those made chemically or biogenically by cells) were tested to passivate the new SARS-CoV-2 XBB variant. Results showed that the combination of any peptide and using either type of Se NP, the Omicron subvariant XBB was inhibited by 100 % after just 15 min in vitro. Interestingly, the use of Se NPs alone outperformed the peptides in terms of XBB passivation. Also, in order to determine a mechanism of action, functionalizing Se nanoparticles with the NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK peptide showed a high binding ability toward the chemotrypsin-like cysteine protease (SARS CoV-2 3CLpro). Further, as a demonstration of their versatility, these functionalized peptides also passivated the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK and NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed in silico interactions with the fusion glycoprotein of RSV prompting in vitro RSV pseudo virus testing. Compared to the conventionally precipitated synthetic Se nanoparticles, in vitro results showed that biogenic Se functionalized with the peptides enhanced the inhibition RSV to 100 % after just 15 min of incubation. NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK and NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK also showed no potential genotoxicity or carcinogenic effects. The peptides showed good gastro-intestinal (GI) tract absorption and bioavailability as predicted using the partition coefficient (QP logPo/w), and high-water solubility as detected by QPlogS. According to these promising results, functionalizing biogenic Se nanoparticles with these novel peptides should be further studied in vivo for the improved diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory virus infections.

21,Nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted in Syrian hamsters,,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) is one of the promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir is the only the 3CLpro inhibitor authorized for treatment of COVID-19 patients at high risk of hospitalization; other 3Lpro inhibitors are in development. We recently repored on the in vitro selection of a SARS-CoV2 3CLpro (L50F-E166A-L167F; short 3CLprores) virus that is cross-resistant with nirmatrelvir and yet other 3CLpro inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that the resistant virus replicates efficiently in the lungs of intranassaly infected hamsters and that it causes a lung pathology that is comparable to that caused by the WT virus. Moreover, 3CLprores infected hamsters transmit the virus efficiently to co-housed non-infected contact hamsters. Fortunately, resistance to Nirmatrelvir does not readily develop (in the clinical setting) since the drug has a relatively high barrier to resistance. Yet, as we demonstrate, in case resistant viruses emerge, they may easily spread and impact therapeutic options for others. Therefore, the use of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protease inhibitors in combinations with drugs that have a different mechanism of action, may be considered to avoid the development of drug-resistant viruses in the future.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

261,Viral proteases as therapeutic targets.,2022 Dec,"Some medically important viruses-including retroviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses-code for a protease, which is indispensable for viral maturation and pathogenesis. Viral protease inhibitors have become an important class of antiviral drugs. Development of the first-in-class viral protease inhibitor saquinavir, which targets HIV protease, started a new era in the treatment of chronic viral diseases. Combining several drugs that target different steps of the viral life cycle enables use of lower doses of individual drugs (and thereby reduction of potential side effects, which frequently occur during long term therapy) and reduces drug-resistance development. Currently, several HIV and HCV protease inhibitors are routinely used in clinical practice. In addition, a drug including an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, nirmatrelvir (co-administered with a pharmacokinetic booster ritonavir as Paxlovid R), was recently authorized for emergency use. This review summarizes the basic features of the proteases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the properties of their inhibitors in clinical use, as well as development of compounds in the pipeline.

However, the existence of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir-resistant isolates underscores the need to develop next-generation drugs with different resistance profiles and/or distinct mechanisms of action. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput screen of 649,568 compounds using a cellular gain-of-signal assay. In this assay, Mpro inhibits expression of a luciferase reporter, and 8,777 small molecules were considered hits by causing a gain in luciferase activity 3x SD above the sample field activity (6.8% gain-of-signal relative to 100 microM GC376). Single concentration and dose-response gain-of-signal experiments confirmed 3,522/8,762 compounds as candidate inhibitors. In parallel, all initial high-throughput screening hits were tested in a peptide cleavage assay with purified Mpro and only 39/8,762 showed inhibition. Importantly, 19/39 compounds (49%) re-tested positive in both SARS2 assays, including two previously reported Mpro inhibitors, demonstrating the efficacy of the overall screening strategy. This approach led to the rediscovery of known Mpro inhibitors such as calpain inhibitor II, as well as to the discovery of novel compounds that provide chemical information for future drug development efforts.

1,Generation and evaluation of protease inhibitor-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains,,"Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the search for antiviral therapies has been at the forefront of medical research. To date, the 3CLpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) has shown the best results in clinical trials and the greatest robustness against variants. A second SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor, ensitrelvir (Xocova), has been developed. Ensitrelvir, currently in Phase 3, was approved in Japan under the emergency regulatory approval procedure in November 2022, and is available since March 31, 2023. One of the limitations for the use of antiviral monotherapies is the emergence of resistance mutations. Here, we experimentally generated mutants resistant to nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir in vitro following repeating passages of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of both antivirals. For both molecules, we demonstrated a loss of sensitivity for resistance mutants in vitro. Using a Syrian golden hamster infection model, we showed that the ensitrelvir M49L mutation, in the multi-passage strain, confers a high level of in vivo resistance. Finally, we identified a recent increase in the prevalence of M49L-carrying sequences, which appears to be associated with multiple repeated emergence events in Japan and may be related to the use of Xocova in the country since November 2022. These results highlight the strategic importance of genetic monitoring of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains to ensure that treatments administered retain their full effectiveness.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

69,Clinical experience in the treatment of COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies in solid organ transplant recipients,,"Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at high risk for complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SOT recipients mount lower immunological responses to vaccines than general population and are at high risk for breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Passive immunotherapy in the form of anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) may be an alterna-tive for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved by accumulating resistance mutations that have escaped the neutralizing action of most MoAbs. However, MoAbs directed at more conserved epitopes and that maintain effector functions could maintain efficacy in the treatment of these patients. According to published da-ta, SOT recipients with low anti-spike antibody responses to vaccination could benefit from the use of MoAbs in pre-expo-sure prophylaxis, in the treatment of COVID-19 mild to moderate and severe COVID-19 with less than 15 days of symptom duration and low oxygen requirements. Combination therapy could be more effective than monotherapy for the treatment of mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright Â© The Author 2023.

51,Pre-exposure prophylaxis of non-HIV viral infections and the role of long-acting antivirals,,"Viruses cause a large burden of human infectious diseases. During the past 50 years, antivirals have been developed to treat many pathogenic viruses, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, hepatitis viruses, and influenza. Besides being used as treatment, antivirals have shown efficacy for preventing certain viral infections. Following the success in the HIV field, a renewed interest has emerged on the use of antivirals as prophylaxis for other viruses. The development of formulations with extended half-life has pushed further this consideration in persons at risk for a wide range of viral infections. In this way, long-acting antivirals might behave as ""chemovaccines"" when classical vaccines do not exist, cannot be recommended, immune responses are suboptimal, escape mutants emerge, and/or immunity wanes. Five main caveats would tem-per its use, namely, selection of drug resistance, drug interactions, short-and long-term side effects, potential teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age, and high cost. Herein, we discuss the prospects for long-acting antivirals as prophylaxis of human viral infections other than HIV.Copyright Â©Permanyer2023.",Soriano V.; Moreno-Torres V.; Mendoza C.; Fernandez-Montero J.V.; Trevino A.; Corral O.; Jesus F.; Barreiro P.,,1139-6121,/10.24875/AIDSRev.M23000066,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.24875%2fAIDSRev.M23000066,,,,138

278,Challenges of short substrate analogues as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,2021 10 15,"Specific anti-coronaviral drugs complementing available vaccines are urgently needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Given its high conservation across the betacoronavirus genus and dissimilarity to human proteases, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is an attractive drug target. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have been developed at unprecedented speed, most of them being substrate-derived peptidomimetics with cysteine-modifying warheads. In this study, Mpro has proven resistant towards the identification of high-affinity short substrate-derived peptides and peptidomimetics without warheads. 20 cyclic and linear substrate analogues bearing natural and unnatural residues, which were predicted by computational modelling to bind with high affinity and designed to establish structure-activity relationships, displayed no inhibitory activity at concentrations as high as 100 muM. Only a long linear peptide covering residues P6 to P5' displayed moderate inhibition (Ki = 57 microM). Our detailed findings will inform current and future drug discovery campaigns targeting Mpro.

241,"SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Drug Design, Assay Development, and Drug Resistance Studies.",2023 01 17,"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to more than 6.5 million deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019. The unprecedented disruption of social life and public health caused by COVID-19 calls for fast-track development of diagnostic kits, vaccines, and antiviral drugs. Small molecule antivirals are essential complements of vaccines and can be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Currently, there are three FDA-approved antiviral drugs, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and paxlovid. Given the moderate clinical efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir, the drug-drug interaction of paxlovid, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potential drug-resistant mutations, there is a pressing need for additional antivirals to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks. In this Account, we describe our efforts in developing covalent and noncovalent main protease (Mpro) inhibitors and the identification of nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants. We initially discovered GC376, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and boceprevir as dual inhibitors of Mpro and host cathepsin L from a screening of a protease inhibitor library. Given the controversy of targeting cathepsin L, we subsequently shifted the focus to designing Mpro-specific inhibitors. Specifically, guided by the X-ray crystal structures of these initial hits, we designed noncovalent Mpro inhibitors such as Jun8-76-3R that are highly selective toward Mpro over host cathepsin L. Using the same scaffold, we also designed covalent Mpro inhibitors with novel cysteine reactive warheads containing di- and trihaloacetamides, which similarly had high target specificity. In parallel to our drug discovery efforts, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP Mpro assay to characterize the cellular target engagement of our rationally designed Mpro inhibitors. The FlipGFP assay was also applied to validate the structurally disparate Mpro inhibitors reported in the literature. Lastly, we introduce recent progress in identifying naturally occurring Mpro mutants that are resistant to nirmatrelvir from genome mining of the nsp5 sequences deposited in the GISAID database. Collectively, the covalent and noncovalent Mpro inhibitors and the nirmatrelvir-resistant hot spot residues from our studies provide insightful guidance for future work aimed at developing orally bioavailable Mpro inhibitors that do not have overlapping resistance profile with nirmatrelvir.",Tan B; Joyce R; Tan H; Hu Y; Wang J,,,/10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00735,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med23&DO=10.1021%2facs.accounts.2c00735,,,,141
129,Ensitrelvir as a potential treatment for COVID-19,,"Introduction: First-generation therapeutics have improved clinical outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, viral evolution has produced variants and subvariants capable of resisting many of these drugs and novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Areas covered: A corporate compound library screen identified ensitrelvir (formerly S-217622), a non-covalent, non-peptidic, orally bioavailable small-molecule protease inhibitor as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Ensitrelvir cleaves the active site of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which is conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants, with no human cell protease with similar specificity. Expert opinion: Ensitrelvir demonstrates strong in vitro antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which have driven new waves of infection throughout 2022, suggesting a potential therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript reviews what is known about ensitrelvir and explores how this drug may be used in the future to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Copyright Â© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",McCarthy M.W.,,1465-6566,/10.1080/14656566.2022.2146493,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1080%2f14656566.2022.2146493,,,,142
177,The small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro EDP-235 prevents viral replication and transmission in vivo.,2024 Aug 01,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the deaths of millions of people and severe global economic impacts. Small molecule therapeutics have played an important role in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but their efficacy has been limited in scope and availability, with many people unable to access their benefits, and better options are needed. EDP-235 is specifically designed to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with potent nanomolar activity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants to date, as well as clinically relevant human and zoonotic coronaviruses. EDP-235 maintains potency against variants bearing mutations associated with nirmatrelvir resistance. Additionally, EDP-235 demonstrates a >= 500-fold selectivity index against multiple host proteases. In a male Syrian hamster model of COVID-19, EDP-235 suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and viral-induced hamster lung pathology. In a female ferret model, EDP-235 inhibits production of SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus and RNA at multiple anatomical sites. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 contact transmission does not occur when naive ferrets are co-housed with infected, EDP-235-treated ferrets. Collectively, these results demonstrate that EDP-235 is a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with efficacy in animal models of primary infection and transmission. Copyright Â© 2024.

96,Comparative Performance Evaluation of Personal Protective Measures and Antiviral Agents Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants: A Narrative Review,,"Scientists identified SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China. Soon after its identification, Covid-19 spreads almost everywhere. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Countries are facing multiple waves due to the different variants of the coronavirus. Personal preventive measures, vaccines, and antiviral drugs are the approaches to control Covid-19. However, these approaches are being implemented in different countries at different levels because of the availability of personal protective measures and antiviral agents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of practicing measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Here we searched relevant literature from PubMed and Scopus using the keywords such as personal protective measures, antiviral agents, and vaccine effectiveness. According to the present findings, protective measures were found comparatively less effective. Nevertheless, these measures can be used to limit the spreading of Covid-19. Antiviral agents can reduce the hospitalization rate and are more effective than personal protective measures. The most effective strategy against Covid-19 is early vaccination or multiple vaccination dose. The respective authorities should ensure equal distribution of vaccines, free availability of antiviral drugs, and personal protective measure in poor and developing countries. We recommend more studies to describe the effectiveness of practicing preventive measures and antiviral agents against recent variants of the coronavirus.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.",Haque M.A.; Tanbir M.; Ahamed B.; Hossain M.J.; Roy A.; Shahriar M.; Bhuiyan M.A.; Islam M.R.,,2632-010X (electronic),/10.1177/2632010X231161222,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1177%2f2632010X231161222,,,,144
167,Artificial intelligence-aiding lab-on-a-chip workforce designed oral [3.1.0] bi and [4.2.0] tricyclic catalytic interceptors inhibiting multiple SARS-CoV-2 protomers assisted by double-shell deep learning.,2024 Aug 22,"While each massive pandemic has claimed the lives of millions of vulnerable populations over the centuries, one limitation exists: that the Edisonian approach (human-directed with trial errors) relies on repurposing pharmaceuticals, designing drugs, and herbal remedies with the violation of Lipinski's rule of five druglikeness. It may lead to adverse health effects with long-term health multimorbidity. Nevertheless, declining birth rates and aging populations will likely cause a shift in society due to a shortage of a scientific workforce to defend against the next pandemic incursion. The challenge of combating the ongoing post-COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of gold standard drugs to deactivate multiple SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Meanwhile, there are three FDA-approved antivirals, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Paxlovid, with moderate clinical efficacy and drug resistance. There is a pressing need for additional antivirals and prepared omics technology to combat the current and future devastating coronavirus pandemics. While there is a limitation of existing contemporary inhibitors to deactivate viral RNA replication with minimal rotational bonds, one strategy is to create Lipinski inhibitors with less than 10 rotational bonds and precise halogen bond placement to destabilize multiple viral protomers. This work describes the efforts to design gold-standard oral inhibitors of bi- and tri-cyclic catalytic interceptors with electrophilic heads using double-shell deep learning. Here, KS1 with and KS2 compounds designed by lab-on-a-chip technology attain 5-fold novel filtered-Lipinski, GHOSE, VEBER, EGAN, and MUEGGE druglikeness. The graph neural network (GNN) relies on module-initiation, expansion, relabeling atom index, and termination (METORITE) iterations, while the deep neural network (DNN) engages pinning, extraction, convolution, pooling, and flattening (PROOF) operations. The cyclic compound's specific halogen atom location enhances the nitrile catalytic head, which deactivates several viral protein targets. Initiating this lab-on-a-chip that is not susceptible to the aging process for creating clinical compounds can leverage a new path to many valuable drugs with speedy oral drug discovery, especially to defend the loss of vulnerable population and prevent multimorbidity that is susceptible to hidden viral persistence in the continuing aging times.

BA.2.75 is a BA.2 descendant but is phylogenetically distinct from BA.5, the currently predominant BA.2 descendant. Here, we show that BA.2.75 has a greater effective reproduction number and different immunogenicity profile than BA.5. We determined the sensitivity of BA.2.75 to vaccinee and convalescent sera as well as a panel of clinically available antiviral drugs and antibodies. Antiviral drugs largely retained potency, but antibody sensitivity varied depending on several key BA.2.75-specific substitutions. The BA.2.75 spike exhibited a profoundly higher affinity for its human receptor, ACE2. Additionally, the fusogenicity, growth efficiency in human alveolar epithelial cells, and intrinsic pathogenicity in hamsters of BA.2.75 were greater than those of BA.2. Our multilevel investigations suggest that BA.2.75 acquired virological properties independent of BA.5, and the potential risk of BA.2.75 to global health is greater than that of BA.5.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s)",Saito A.; Tamura T.; Zahradnik J.; Deguchi S.; Tabata K.; Anraku Y.; Kimura I.; Ito J.; Yamasoba D.; Nasser H.; Toyoda M.; Nagata K.; Uriu K.; Kosugi Y.; Fujita S.; Shofa M.; Monira Begum M.S.T.; Shimizu R.; Oda Y.; Suzuki R.; Ito H.; Nao N.; Wang L.; Tsuda M.; Yoshimatsu K.; Kuramochi J.; Kita S.; Sasaki-Tabata K.; Fukuhara H.; Maenaka K.; Yamamoto Y.; Nagamoto T.; Asakura H.; Nagashima M.; Sadamasu K.; Yoshimura K.; Ueno T.; Schreiber G.; Takaori-Kondo A.; Shirakawa K.; Sawa H.; Irie T.; Hashiguchi T.; Takayama K.; Matsuno K.; Tanaka S.; Ikeda T.; Fukuhara T.; Sato K.,,1931-3128,/10.1016/j.chom.2022.10.003,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.chom.2022.10.003,,,,146

150,IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS EXERT DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS AGAINST PAN-CORONAVIRUS INFECTION AND DISTINCT COMBINATORY ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY WITH MOLNUPIRAVIR AND NIRMATRELVIR,,"Introduction: There are seven types of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, including three highly pathogenic members MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and four seasonal coronaviruses, including NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1. Immunocompromised populations, such as organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medications and patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies, are in general more susceptible to coronavirus infections. However, little is known how immunosuppressants directly affect coronavirus infection. Aims & Methods: This study aims to profile the effects of immunosuppressants and the combination of immunosuppressants with oral antiviral drug molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir on pan-coronavirus infection in cell culture models. Different coronaviruses (including wild type, delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, NL63, 229E and OC43) were used in cell culture models. The effects of immunosuppressants including dexamethasone, budesonide, prednisolone, sulfasalazine, aminosalicylates, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, mycophenolic acid (MPA), rapamycin, everolimus, tofacitinib and figotinib on coronavirus infections, and the combination with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir were studied in cell culture. Result(s): To profile the effect of immunosuppressants, we first tested all these regimens at 1 muM on wild type SARS-CoV-2, and then validated on different coronaviruses. We found dexamethasone and aminosalicylates can significantly stimulate the replication of these coronaviruses. For example, treatment with 1 muM dexamethasone significantly increased virus RNA level of wild type SARS-CoV-2 by 137+/-40%. 6-thioguanine, MPA, tofacitinib and figotinib treatment inhibited viral replication in a dosedependent manner in all tested coronaviruses. 6-thioguanine at 1 muM concentration had already potently inhibited the replication of wild type SARS-CoV-2 by 95+/-16%. The half maximum effective concentration (EC50) of tofacitinib against wild type SARS-CoV-2 replication was 0.60 muM and the half maximum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was above 30 muM, which resulted in a selective index (SI) above 50. Combination treatment is often used to enhance antiviral efficacy, avoid drug resistance development in clinical applications. We evaluated the combined antiviral effects of 6-thioguanine, MPA and tofacitinib with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir in wild type SARS-CoV-2 infection model. The combination of tofacitinib with molnupiravir had a moderate additive effect with the ZIP synergy score of 7, whereas the other two combinations had no such effect. However, the combination of MPA, 6-thioguanine, and tofacitinib with nirmatrelvir resulted in strong synergistic effect, and the ZIP synergy scores were 31, 22 and 12 respectively. Conclusion(s): These results demonstrated that different immunosuppressants had differential effects on coronavirus replication. 6-thioguanine, MPA, tofacitinib and figotinib were identified as potent inhibitors against pan-coronavirus infections. Although combination of MPA, 6-thioguanine, and tofacitinib with molnupiravir exerted moderate additive effect, combination with nirmatrelvir exerted strong synergistic antiviral activity. Thus, these findings provide as an important reference for clinicians to choose the optimal immunosuppressants for coronavirus infected immunocompromised patients or when they are under antiviral treatment of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir.",Wang Y.; Li P.; De Vries A.C.; Lavrijsen M.; Bruno M.J.; Peppelenbosch M.P.; Pan Q.,,2050-6414,/10.1002/ueg2.12294,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1002%2fueg2.12294,,,,149
72,Tracing COVID-19 drugs in the environment: Are we focusing on the right environmental compartment?,,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to over 770 million confirmed cases, straining public healthcare systems and necessitating extensive and prolonged use of synthetic chemical drugs around the globe for medical treatment and symptom relief. Concerns have arisen regarding the massive release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their metabolites into the environment, particularly through domestic sewage. While discussions surrounding this issue have primarily centered on their discharge into aquatic environments, particularly through treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), one often overlooked aspect is the terrestrial environment as a significant receptor of pharmaceutical-laden waste. This occurs through the disposal of sewage sludge, for instance, by applying biosolids to land or non-compliant disposal of sewage sludge, in addition to the routine disposal of expired and unused medications in municipal solid wastes. In this article, we surveyed sixteen approved pharmaceuticals for treating COVID-19 and bacterial co-infections, along with their primary metabolites. For this, we delved into their physiochemical properties, ecological toxicities, environmental persistence, and fate within municipal WWTPs. Emphasis was given on lipophilic substances with log Kow >3.0, which are more likely to be found in sewage sludge at significant factions (25.2%-75.0%) of their inputs in raw sewage and subsequently enter the terrestrial environment through land application of biosolids, e.g., 43% in the United States and as high as 96% in Ireland or non-compliant practices of sewage sludge disposal in developing communities, such as open dumping and land application without prior anaerobic digestion. The available evidence underscores the importance of adequately treating and disposing of sewage sludge before its final disposal or land application in an epidemic or pandemic scenario, as mismanaged sewage sludge could be a significant vector for releasing pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites into the terrestrial environment.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Dai H.; Wang C.; Yu W.; Han J.,,0269-7491,/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122732,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.122732,,,,150
104,Orthogonal dual reporter-based gain-of-signal assay for probing SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease activity in living cells: inhibitor identification and mutation investigation,,"The main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like protease, 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 has become a focus of anti-coronavirus research. Despite efforts, drug development targeting 3CLpro has been hampered by limitations in the currently available activity assays. Additionally, the emergence of 3CLpro mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about potential resistance. Both emphasize the need for a more reliable, sensitive, and facile 3CLpro assay. Here, we report an orthogonal dual reporter-based gain-of-signal assay for measuring 3CLpro activity in living cells. It builds on the finding that 3CLpro induces cytotoxicity and reporter expression suppression, which can be rescued by its inhibitor or mutation. This assay circumvents most limitations in previously reported assays, especially false positives caused by nonspecific compounds and signal interference from test compounds. It is also convenient and robust for high throughput screening of compounds and comparing the drug susceptibilities of mutants. Using this assay, we screened 1789 compounds, including natural products and protease inhibitors, with 45 compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro among them. Except for the approved drug PF-07321332, only five of these inhibit 3CLpro in our assays: GC376; PF-00835231; S-217622; Boceprevir; and Z-FA-FMK. The susceptibilities of seven 3CLpro mutants prevalent in circulating variants to PF-07321332, S-217622, and GC376 were also assessed. Three mutants were identified as being less susceptible to PF-07321322 (P132H) and S-217622 (G15S, T21I). This assay should greatly facilitate the development of novel 3CLpro-targeted drugs and the monitoring of the susceptibility of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to 3CLpro inhibitors.Copyright Â© 2023 The Author(s).

97,"COVID-19: Epidemiology, Etiology, Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, Therapeutic Options, and Prevention",,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly progressed to a global pandemic that has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. The most common method of transmission is through respiratory droplets from person to person, yet direct contact and airborne transmission have been reported. The incubation period is usually 2-14 days with a median of 5 days. Initial symptoms include fever, sore throat, cough, and fatigue; however, there is a broad spectrum of less frequent symptoms including gastrointestinal, dermatologic, ocular, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations among others. Most cases are mild, but in high-risk individuals, there is an increased prevalence of complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, thromboembolic events, etc. Currently, there are different molecular, antigen, and serologic tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Most cases of COVID-19 require only supportive care; however, in patients with increased risks factors for complications and for those with moderate to severe disease, specific therapeutic options that include antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, high-titer antibody convalescent plasma, and immunomodulatory agents are indicated. The rapid expansion of vaccines has become the main method of disease prevention; however, public health-care measures such as facemask use, social distancing, and surveillance testing remain vital in the pandemic control.Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Mogollon J.E.; Halaseh G.; Swaminathan N.,,2523-3785,/10.1007/978-3-031-28536-3_1,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1007%2f978-3-031-28536-3_1,,,,152
191,The host-targeted antiviral drug Zapnometinib exhibits a high barrier to the development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance.,2024 May,"Host targeting antiviral drugs (HTA) are directed against cellular mechanisms which can be exploited by viruses. These mechanisms are essential for viral replication, because missing functions cannot be compensated by the virus. However, this assumption needs experimental proof. Here we compared the HTA Zapnometinib (ZMN), with direct acting antivirals (DAA) (Remdesivir (RDV), Molnupiravir (MPV), Nirmatrelvir (NTV), Ritonavir (RTV), Paxlovid PAX)), in terms of their potency to induce reduced drug susceptibilities in SARS-CoV-2. During serial passage of delta-B1.617.2 adaptation to all DAAs occurred, while the inhibitory capacity of ZMN was not altered. Known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for partial resistances were found for RDV, NTV and PAX. Additionally, the high mutagenic potential of MPV was confirmed and decreased drug efficacies were found for the first time. Reduced DAA efficacy did not alter the inhibitory potential of ZMN. These results show that ZMN confers a high barrier towards the development of viral resistance and has the potential to act against partially DAA-insensitive viruses. Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors.

77,COVID-19 Treatments: Then and Now,,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved over the past 3+ years, and strategies to prevent illness and treat infection have changed over time. As COVID-19 transitions from a pandemic to an endemic infection, widespread nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and governmental policies requiring social distancing have given way to more selective strategies for risk mitigation. Monoclonal antibody therapies used for disease prevention and treatment lost utility owing to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Oral antiviral medications have become the mainstay of treatment in nonhospitalized individuals, whereas systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy in those requiring supplemental oxygen. Emerging literature also supports the use of additional immune-modulating therapies in select admitted patients. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both unprecedented research and development of medical interventions while also drawing attention to significant pitfalls in the global response.

210,"A low-background, fluorescent assay to evaluate inhibitors of diverse viral proteases.",2023 08 31,"Multiple coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause respiratory diseases in humans. While prophylactic vaccines designed to prevent infection are available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), incomplete vaccine efficacy, vaccine hesitancy, and the threat of other pathogenic CoVs for which vaccines do not exist have highlighted the need for effective antiviral therapies. While antiviral compounds targeting the viral polymerase and protease are already in clinical use, their sensitivity to potential resistance mutations as well as their breadth against the full range of human and preemergent CoVs remain incompletely defined. To begin to fill that gap in knowledge, we report here the development of an improved, noninfectious, cell-based fluorescent assay with high sensitivity and low background that reports on the activity of viral proteases, which are key drug targets. We demonstrate that the assay is compatible with not only the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein but also orthologues from a range of human and nonhuman CoVs as well as clinically reported SARS-CoV-2 drug-resistant Mpro variants. We then use this assay to define the breadth of activity of two clinically used protease inhibitors, nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. Continued use of this assay will help define the strengths and limitations of current therapies and may also facilitate the development of next-generation protease inhibitors that are broadly active against both currently circulating and preemergent CoVs. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with the ability to cause global pandemics. Working in concert with vaccines, antivirals specifically limit viral disease in people who are actively infected. Antiviral compounds that target CoV proteases are already in clinical use; their efficacy against variant proteases and preemergent zoonotic CoVs, however, remains incompletely defined. Here, we report an improved, noninfectious, and highly sensitive fluorescent method of defining the sensitivity of CoV proteases to small molecule inhibitors. We use this approach to assay the activity of current antiviral therapies against clinically reported SARS-CoV-2 protease mutants and a panel of highly diverse CoV proteases. Additionally, we show this system is adaptable to other structurally nonrelated viral proteases. In the future, this assay can be used to not only better define the strengths and limitations of current therapies but also help develop new, broadly acting inhibitors that more broadly target viral families.",Leonard RA; Rao VN; Bartlett A; Froggatt HM; Luftig MA; Heaton BE; Heaton NS,,,/10.1128/jvi.00597-23,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.1128%2fjvi.00597-23,,,,156
180,Soluble wild-type ACE2 molecules inhibit newer SARS-CoV-2 variants and are a potential antiviral strategy to mitigate disease severity in COVID-19.,2023 12 13,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has caused havoc around the world. While several COVID-19 vaccines and drugs have been authorized for use, these antiviral drugs remain beyond the reach of most low- and middle-income countries. Rapid viral evolution is reducing the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies and contributing to the deaths of some fully vaccinated persons. Others with normal immunity may have chosen not to be vaccinated and remain at risk if they contract the infection. Vaccines may not protect some immunodeficient patients from SARS-CoV-2, who are also at increased risk of chronic COVID-19 infection, a dangerous stalemate between the virus and a suboptimal immune response. Intra-host viral evolution could rapidly lead to the selection and dominance of vaccine and monoclonal antibody-resistant clades of SARS-CoV-2. There is thus an urgent need to develop new treatments for COVID-19. The NZACE2-Patari project, comprising modified soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules, seeks to intercept and block SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory mucosa. In vitro data presented here show that soluble wild-type ACE2 molecules retain the ability to effectively block the Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the ancestral Wuhan, delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) strains. This therapeutic strategy may prove effective if implemented early during the nasal phase of the infection and may act synergistically with other antiviral drugs such as Paxlovid to further mitigate disease severity.

176,A Gaussia luciferase reporter assay for the evaluation of coronavirus Nsp5/3CLpro activity.,2024 09 05,"Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) infect millions of people every year. Among these, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 caused significant morbidity and mortality and their emergence highlights the risk of possible future coronavirus outbreaks. Therefore, broadly-active anti-coronavirus drugs are needed. Pharmacological inhibition of the hCoV protease Nsp5 (3CLpro) is clinically beneficial as shown by the wide and effective use of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir, ritonavir). However, further treatment options are required due to the risk of drug resistance. To facilitate the assessment of coronavirus protease function and its pharmacological inhibition, we developed an assay allowing rapid and reliable quantification of Nsp5 activity under biosafety level 1 conditions. It is based on an ACE2-Gal4 transcription factor fusion protein separated by a Nsp5 recognition site. Cleavage by Nsp5 releases the Gal4 transcription factor, which then induces the expression of Gaussia luciferase. Our assay is compatible with Nsp5 proteases from all hCoVs and allows simultaneous measurement of inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of the tested compounds. Proof-of-concept measurements confirmed that nirmatrelvir, GC376 and lopinavir inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 function. Furthermore, the assay accurately predicted the impact of Nsp5 mutations on catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity. Overall, the reporter assay is suitable for evaluating viral protease activity. Copyright Â© 2024.

Main protease (MPro), a highly conserved protease among various CoVs, is essential for viral replication and pathogenesis, making it a prime target for antiviral drug development. Here, we leverage proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to develop a new class of small-molecule antivirals that induce the degradation of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Among them, MPD2 was demonstrated to effectively reduce MPro protein levels in 293T cells, relying on a time-dependent, CRBN-mediated, and proteasome-driven mechanism. Furthermore, MPD2 exhibited remarkable efficacy in diminishing MPro protein levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-ACE2 cells. MPD2 also displayed potent antiviral activity against various SARS-CoV-2 strains and exhibited enhanced potency against nirmatrelvir-resistant viruses. Overall, this proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of targeted protein degradation of MPro as an innovative approach for developing antivirals that could fight against drug-resistant viral variants.",Alugubelli YR; Xiao J; Khatua K; Kumar S; Sun L; Ma Y; Ma XR; Vulupala VR; Atla S; Blankenship LR; Coleman D; Xie X; Neuman BW; Liu WR; Xu S,,,/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c02416,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1021%2facs.jmedchem.3c02416,,,,159
168,"In silico analysis of balsaminol as anti-viral agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease, spike receptor binding domain and papain-like protease receptors.",2024,"Plant-derived phytochemicals from medicinal plants are becoming increasingly attractive natural sources of antimicrobial and antiviral agents due to their therapeutic value, mechanism of action, level of toxicity and bioavailability. The continued emergence of more immune-evasive strains and the rate of resistance to current antiviral drugs have created a need to identify new antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. This study investigated the antiviral potential of balsaminol, a bioactive compound from Momordica balsamina, and its inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins. In this study, three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) COVID-19 approved drugs namely; nirmatrelvir, ritonavir and remdesivir were used as positive control. Molecular docking was performed to determine the predominant binding mode (most negative Gibbs free energy of binding/DELTAG) and inhibitory activity of balsaminol against SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins. The pharmacokinetics, toxicity, physicochemical and drug-like properties of balsaminol were evaluated to determine its potential as an active oral drug candidate as well as its non-toxicity in humans. The results show that balsaminol E has the highest binding affinity to the SARS CoV-2 papain-like protease (7CMD) with a free binding energy of - 8.7 kcal/mol, followed by balsaminol A interacting with the spike receptor binding domain (6VW1) with - 8.5 kcal/mol and balsaminol C had a binding energy of - 8.1 kcal/mol with the main protease (6LU7) comparable to the standard drugs namely ritonavir, nirmatrelvir and remdesivir. However, the ADMET and drug-like profile of balsaminol F favours it as a better potential drug candidate and inhibitor of the docked SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins. Further preclinical studies are therefore recommended.",Gaiya DD; Muhammad A; Musa JS; Auta R; Dadah AJ; Bello RO; Hassan M; Eke SS; Odihi RI; Sankey M,,2193-9616,/10.1007/s40203-024-00241-0,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm&DO=10.1007%2fs40203-024-00241-0,,,,160
200,"Covalent-reversible peptide-based protease inhibitors. Design, synthesis, and clinical success stories.",2023 Dec,"Dysregulated human peptidases are implicated in a large variety of diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and neurodegeneration. Viral proteases for their part are crucial for the pathogens' maturation and assembly. Several decades of research were devoted to exploring these precious therapeutic targets, often addressing them with synthetic substrate-based inhibitors to elucidate their biological roles and develop medications. The rational design of peptide-based inhibitors offered a rapid pathway to obtain a variety of research tools and drug candidates. Non-covalent modifiers were historically the first choice for protease inhibition due to their reversible enzyme binding mode and thus presumably safer profile. However, in recent years, covalent-irreversible inhibitors are having a resurgence with dramatic increase of their related publications, preclinical and clinical trials, and FDA-approved drugs. Depending on the context, covalent modifiers could provide more effective and selective drug candidates, hence requiring lower doses, thereby limiting off-target effects. Additionally, such molecules seem more suitable to tackle the crucial issue of cancer and viral drug resistances. At the frontier of reversible and irreversible based inhibitors, a new drug class, the covalent-reversible peptide-based inhibitors, has emerged with the FDA approval of Bortezomib in 2003, shortly followed by 4 other listings to date. The highlight in the field is the breathtakingly fast development of the first oral COVID-19 medication, Nirmatrelvir. Covalent-reversible inhibitors can hipothetically provide the safety of the reversible modifiers combined with the high potency and specificity of their irreversible counterparts. Herein, we will present the main groups of covalent-reversible peptide-based inhibitors, focusing on their design, synthesis, and successful drug development programs. Copyright Â© 2023.

111,Pharmacological disruption of mSWI/SNF complex activity restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection,,"Identification of host determinants of coronavirus infection informs mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and can provide new drug targets. Here we demonstrate that mammalian SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes, specifically canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (cBAF) complexes, promote severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and represent host-directed therapeutic targets. The catalytic activity of SMARCA4 is required for mSWI/SNF-driven chromatin accessibility at the ACE2 locus, ACE2 expression and virus susceptibility. The transcription factors HNF1A/B interact with and recruit mSWI/SNF complexes to ACE2 enhancers, which contain high HNF1A motif density. Notably, small-molecule mSWI/SNF ATPase inhibitors or degraders abrogate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and confer resistance to SARS-CoV-2 variants and a remdesivir-resistant virus in three cell lines and three primary human cell types, including airway epithelial cells, by up to 5 logs.

265,Generation of a VeroE6 Pgp gene knock out cell line and its use in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral study.,2022 12,"Vero cells are widely used for antiviral tests and virology research for SARS-CoV-2 as well as viruses from various other families. However, Vero cells generally express high levels of multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) or Pgp protein, the efflux transporter of foreign substances including many antiviral compounds, affecting the antiviral activity as well as interpretation of data. To address this, a Pgp gene knockout VeroE6 cell line (VeroE6-Pgp-KO) was generated using CRISPR-CAS9 technology. These cells no longer expressed the Pgp protein as indicated by flow cytometry analysis following staining with a Pgp-specific monoclonal antibody. They also showed significantly reduced efflux transporter activity in the calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM) assay. The VeroE6-Pgp-KO cells and the parental VeroE6 cells were each infected with SARS-CoV-2 to test antiviral activities of remdesivir and nirmatrelvir, two known Pgp substrates, in the presence or absence of a Pgp inhibitor. The compounds showed antiviral activities in VeroE6-Pgp-KO cells similar to that observed in the presence of the Pgp inhibitor. Thus, the newly established VeroE6-Pgp-KO cell line adds a new in vitro virus infection system for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses to test antiviral therapies without a need to control the Pgp activity. Removal of the Pgp inhibitor for antiviral assays will lead to less data variation and prevent failed assays. Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Multiple retrospective studies have also demonstrated monoclonal antibodies are effective in SOTR populations. However, the evolution of resistant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concerns has resulted in revocation of the authorization of bamlanivimab with or without etesevimab, and casirivimab-imdevimab as treatment and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Sotrovimab and bebtelovimab are currently authorized for treatment of the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron), but not as pre or PEP.

108,"Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Variants: Implications on Immune Escape, Vaccination, Therapeutic and Diagnostic Strategies",,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower fatality rate than its SARS and MERS counterparts. However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has given rise to multiple variants with varying pathogenicity and transmissibility, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Individuals with advanced age or underlying comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, are at a higher risk of increased disease severity. Hence, this has resulted in an urgent need for the development of better therapeutic and preventive approaches. This review describes the origin and evolution of human coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2 and its variants as well as sub-variants. Risk factors that contribute to disease severity and the implications of co-infections are also considered. In addition, various antiviral strategies against COVID-19, including novel and repurposed antiviral drugs targeting viral and host proteins, as well as immunotherapeutic strategies, are discussed.

48,Recent Advances on Targeting Proteases for Antiviral Development,,"Viral proteases are an important target for drug development, since they can modulate vital pathways in viral replication, maturation, assembly and cell entry. With the (re)appearance of several new viruses responsible for causing diseases in humans, like the West Nile virus (WNV) and the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), understanding the mechanisms behind blocking viral protease's function is pivotal for the development of new antiviral drugs and therapeutical strategies. Apart from directly inhibiting the target protease, usually by targeting its active site, several new pathways have been explored to impair its activity, such as inducing protein aggregation, targeting allosteric sites or by inducing protein degradation by cellular proteasomes, which can be extremely valuable when considering the emerging drug-resistant strains. In this review, we aim to discuss the recent advances on a broad range of viral proteases inhibitors, therapies and molecular approaches for protein inactivation or degradation, giving an insight on different possible strategies against this important class of antiviral target.Copyright Â© 2024 by the authors.",Borges P.H.O.; Ferreira S.B.; Silva F.P.,,1999-4915 (electronic),/10.3390/v16030366,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3390%2fv16030366,,,,167
30,The P132H mutation in the main protease of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 decreases thermal stability without compromising catalysis or small-molecule drug inhibition,,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a significant threat to global health. First reported in November 2021, the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is more transmissible and can evade immunity better than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, fueling an unprecedented surge in cases. To produce functional proteins from this polyprotein, SARS-CoV-2 relies on the cysteine proteases Nsp3/papain-like protease (PLpro) and Nsp5/Main Protease (Mpro)/3C-like protease to cleave at three and more than 11 sites, respectively.1 Therefore, Mpro and PLpro inhibitors are considered to be some of the most promising SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. On December 22, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for PAXLOVID, a ritonavir-boosted formulation of nirmatrelvir. Nirmatrelvir is a first-in-class orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor.2 Thus, the scientific community must vigilantly monitor potential mechanisms of drug resistance, especially because SARS-CoV-2 is naive to Mpro inhibitors. Mutations have been well identified in variants to this point.3 Notably, Omicron Mpro (OMpro) harbors a single mutation- P132H. In this study we characterize the enzymatic activity, drug inhibition, and structure of OMpro while evaluating the past and future implications of Mpro mutations.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

146,SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: recent progress and future perspectives,,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been a few variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), one of which is the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). The Omicron variant is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant, and its high transmissibility and immune evasion ability have raised global concerns. Owing to its enhanced transmissibility, Omicron has rapidly replaced Delta as the dominant variant in several regions. However, recent studies have shown that the Omicron variant exhibits reduced pathogenicity due to altered cell tropism. In addition, Omicron exhibits significant resistance to the neutralizing activity of vaccines, convalescent serum, and most antibody therapies. In the present review, recent advances in the molecular and clinical characteristics of the infectivity, pathogenicity, and immune evasion of Omicron variant was summarized, and potential therapeutic applications in response to Omicron infection were discussed. Furthermore, we highlighted potential response to future waves and strategies to end the pandemic.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).",Fan Y.; Li X.; Wan S.; Zhang L.; Zhou F.,,2095-9907,/10.1038/s41392-022-00997-x,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1038%2fs41392-022-00997-x,,,,169
218,Role of available COVID-19 vaccines in reducing deaths and perspective for next generation vaccines and therapies to counter emerging viral variants: an update.,2023 Oct,"The COVID-19 disease wreaked havoc all over the world causing more than 6 million deaths out of over 519 million confirmed cases. It not only disturbed the human race health-wise but also caused huge economic losses and social disturbances. The utmost urgency to counter pandemic was to develop effective vaccines as well as treatments that could reduce the incidences of infection, hospitalization and deaths. The most known vaccines that could help in managing these parameters are Oxford-AstraZeneca (AZD1222), Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Johnson & Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S). The effectiveness of AZD1222 vaccine in reducing deaths is 88% in the age group 40-59 years, touching 100% in the age group 16-44 years & 65-84 years. BNT162b2 vaccine also did well in reducing deaths due to COVID-19 (95% in the age group 40-49 years and 100% in the age group 16-44 years. Similarly, mRNA-1273 vaccine showed potential in reducing COVID-19 deaths with effectiveness ranging from 80.3 to 100% depending upon age group of the vaccinated individuals. Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was also 100% effective in reducing COVID-19 deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants have emphasized the need of booster vaccine doses to enhance protective immunity in vaccinated individuals. Additionally, therapeutic effectiveness of Molnupiravir, Paxlovid and Evusheld are also providing resistance against the spread of COVID-19 disease as well as may be effective against emerging variants. This review highlights the progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines, their protective efficacies, advances being made to design more efficacious vaccines, and presents an overview on advancements in developing potent drugs and monoclonal antibodies for countering COVID-19 and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 including the most recently emerged and highly mutated Omicron variant.",Wahid M; Jawed A; Mandal RK; Areeshi MY; El-Shall NA; Mohapatra RK; Tuli HS; Dhama K; Pellicano R; Fagoonee S; Haque S,,,/10.23736/S0026-4806.23.08509-9,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.23736%2fS0026-4806.23.08509-9,,,,170
211,Exploring diverse reactive warheads for the design of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,2023 Nov 05,"SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a validated antiviral drug target of nirmatrelvir, the active ingredient in Pfizer's oral drug Paxlovid. Drug-drug interactions limit the use of Paxlovid. In addition, drug-resistant Mpro mutants against nirmatrelvir have been identified from cell culture viral passage and naturally occurring variants. As such, there is a need for a second generation of Mpro inhibitors. In this study, we explored several reactive warheads in the design of Mpro inhibitors. We identified Jun11119R (vinyl sulfonamide warhead), Jun10221R (propiolamide warhead), Jun1112R (4-chlorobut-2-ynamide warhead), Jun10541R (nitrile warhead), and Jun10963R (dually activated nitrile warhead) as potent Mpro inhibitors. Jun10541R and Jun10963R also had potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells with EC50 values of 2.92 and 6.47 muM, respectively. X-ray crystal structures of Mpro with Jun10541R and Jun10221 revealed covalent modification of Cys145.

New oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 such as paxlovid have recently authorized. Evidence shows that these antivirals have good efficacy in reducing the risk of hospitalization in COVID-19 positive patients. Remdesivir is an authorized antiviral for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

203,A novel class of broad-spectrum active-site-directed 3C-like protease inhibitors with nanomolar antiviral activity against highly immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants.,2023 Dec,"Antivirals with broad coronavirus activity are important for treating high-risk individuals exposed to the constantly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) as well as emerging drug-resistant variants. We developed and characterized a novel class of active-site-directed 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors (C2-C5a). Our lead direct-acting antiviral (DAA), C5a, is a non-covalent, non-peptide with a dissociation constant of 170 nM against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The compounds C2-C5a exhibit broad-spectrum activity against Omicron subvariants (BA.5, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5) and seasonal human coronavirus-229E infection in human cells. Notably, C5a has median effective concentrations of 30-50 nM against BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 in two different human cell lines. X-ray crystallography has confirmed the unique binding modes of C2-C5a to the 3CLpro, which can limit virus cross-resistance to emerging Paxlovid-resistant variants. We tested the effect of C5a with two of our newly discovered host-directed antivirals (HDAs): N-0385, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, and bafilomycin D (BafD), a human vacuolar H+-ATPase [V-ATPase] inhibitor. We demonstrated a synergistic action of C5a in combination with N-0385 and BafD against Omicron BA.5 infection in human Calu-3 lung cells. Our findings underscore that a SARS-CoV-2 multi-targeted treatment for circulating Omicron subvariants based on DAAs (C5a) and HDAs (N-0385 or BafD) can lead to therapeutic benefits by enhancing treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the high-resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with C2-C5a will facilitate future rational optimization of our novel broad-spectrum active-site-directed 3C-like protease inhibitors.",Perez-Vargas J; Worrall LJ; Olmstead AD; Ton AT; Lee J; Villanueva I; Thompson CAH; Dudek S; Ennis S; Smith JR; Shapira T; De Guzman J; Gang S; Ban F; Vuckovic M; Bielecki M; Kovacic S; Kenward C; Hong CY; Gordon DG; Levett PN; Krajden M; Leduc R; Boudreault PL; Niikura M; Paetzel M; Young RN; Cherkasov A; Strynadka NCJ; Jean F,,,/10.1080/22221751.2023.2246594,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.1080%2f22221751.2023.2246594,,,,173

83,Large library docking for novel SARS-CoV-2 main protease non-covalent and covalent inhibitors,,"Antiviral therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 are needed to diminish the morbidity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A well-precedented drug target is the main viral protease (MPro), which is targeted by an approved drug and by several investigational drugs. Emerging viral resistance has made new inhibitor chemotypes more pressing. Adopting a structure-based approach, we docked 1.2 billion non-covalent lead-like molecules and a new library of 6.5 million electrophiles against the enzyme structure. From these, 29 non-covalent and 11 covalent inhibitors were identified in 37 series, the most potent having an IC50 of 29 and 20 muM, respectively. Several series were optimized, resulting in low micromolar inhibitors. Subsequent crystallography confirmed the docking predicted binding modes and may template further optimization. While the new chemotypes may aid further optimization of MPro inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, the modest success rate also reveals weaknesses in our approach for challenging targets like MPro versus other targets where it has been more successful, and versus other structure-based techniques against MPro itself.Copyright Â© 2023 The Protein Society.",Fink E.A.; Bardine C.; Gahbauer S.; Singh I.; Detomasi T.C.; White K.; Gu S.; Wan X.; Chen J.; Ary B.; Glenn I.; O'Connell J.; O'Donnell H.; Fajtova P.; Lyu J.; Vigneron S.; Young N.J.; Kondratov I.S.; Alisoltani A.; Simons L.M.; Lorenzo-Redondo R.; Ozer E.A.; Hultquist J.F.; O'Donoghue A.J.; Moroz Y.S.; Taunton J.; Renslo A.R.; Irwin J.J.; Garcia-Sastre A.; Shoichet B.K.; Craik C.S.,,0961-8368,/10.1002/pro.4712,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1002%2fpro.4712,,,,176
184,"Glycyrrhizic acid conjugates with amino acid methyl esters target the main protease, exhibiting antiviral activity against wild-type and nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2024 Jul,"COVID-19 pandemic is predominantly caused by SARS-CoV-2, with its main protease, Mpro, playing a pivotal role in viral replication and serving as a potential target for inhibiting different variants. In this study, potent Mpro inhibitors were identified from glycyrrhizic acid (GL) derivatives with amino acid methyl/ethyl esters. Out of the 17 derivatives semisynthesized, Compounds 2, 6, 9, and 15, with methionine methyl esters, D-tyrosine methyl esters, glutamic acid methyl esters, and methionines in the carbohydrate moiety, respectively, significantly inhibited wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-mediated proteolysis, with IC50 values ranging from 0.06 muM to 0.84 muM. They also demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting trans-cleavage by mutant Mpro variants (Mpro_P132H, Mpro_E166V, Mpro_P168A, Mpro_Q189I), with IC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.92 muM, surpassing nirmatrelvir (IC50: 1.17-152.9 muM). Molecular modeling revealed stronger interactions with Valine166 in the structural complex of Mpro_E166V with the compounds compared to nirmatrelvir. Moreover, these compounds efficiently inhibited the post-entry viral processes of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 single-round infectious particles (SRIPs), mitigating viral cytopathic effects and reducing replicon-driven GFP reporter signals, as well as in vitro infectivity of wild-type, Mpro_E166V, and Mpro_Q189I SRIPs, with EC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 0.53 muM. However, nirmatrelvir showed a significant decrease in inhibiting the replication of mutant SARS-CoV-2 SRIPs carrying Mpro_E166V (EC50: >20 muM) and Mpro_Q189I (EC50: 13.2 muM) compared to wild-type SRIPs (EC50: 0.06 muM).

29,"Nirmatrelvir, an orally active Mpro inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern",,"New variants of SARS-CoV-2 with potential for enhanced transmission, replication, and immune evasion capabilities continue to emerge causing reduced vaccine efficacy and/or treatment failure. As of January 2021, the WHO has defined five 'variants of concern' (VOC): B.1.1.7 (Alpha, alpha), B.1.351 (Beta, beta), P.1 (Gamma, gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta, delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron, O). To provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 and variants, Nirmatrelvir, the antiviral component of PAXLOVIDTM, an oral outpatient treatment recently authorized for conditional or emergency use treatment of COVID-19, was developed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a specific inhibitor of coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also referred to as 3CLpro), with potent antiviral activity against several human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS (Owen et al, Science 2021. doi: 10.1126/science.abl4784). Here, we evaluated PF-07321332 against the five SARS-CoV-2 VOC (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, O) and two Variants of Interest or VOI, C.37 (lambda) and B.1.621 (micro), using qRT-PCR in VeroE6 cells lacking the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) multidrug transporter gene (VeroE6 P-gp knockout cells). Nirmatrelvir potently inhibited USA-WA1/2020 strain, and alpha, beta, gamma, lambda, delta mu, and O variants in VeroE6 P-gp knockout cells with mean EC50 values 38.0 nM, 41.0 nM, 127.2 nM, 24.9 nM, 21.2 nM, 15.9 nM, 25.7 nM and 16.2 nM, respectively. Sequence analysis of the Mpro encoded by the variants showed ~100% identity of active site amino acid sequences, reflecting the essential role of Mpro during viral replication leading to ability of Nirmatrelvir to exhibit potent activity across all the variants.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

2,Identification of key residues in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases for resistance against clinically applied inhibitors nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir,,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an epidemic, zoonotically emerging pathogen initially reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV has the potential to mutate or recombine with other coronaviruses, thus acquiring the ability to efficiently spread among humans and become pandemic. Its high mortality rate of up to 35 % and the absence of effective targeted therapies call for the development of antiviral drugs for this pathogen. Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, extensive research has focused on identifying protease inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Our intention was therefore to assess whether these protease inhibitors are viable options for combating MERS-CoV. To that end, we used previously established protease assays to quantify inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV main proteases. Furthermore, we selected MERS-CoV-Mpro mutants resistant against nirmatrelvir, the most effective inhibitor of this protease, with a safe, surrogate virus-based system, and suggest putative resistance mechanisms. Notably, nirmatrelvir demonstrated effectiveness against various viral proteases, illustrating its potential as a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor. To adress the inherent resistance of MERS-CoV-Mpro to ensitrelvir, we applied directed mutagenesis to a key ensitrelvir-interacting residue and provided structural models.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

223,DNA-encoded chemical libraries yield non-covalent and non-peptidic SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,2023 Aug 04,"The development of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 has mostly benefitted from X-ray structures and preexisting knowledge of inhibitors; however, an efficient method to generate Mpro inhibitors, which circumvents such information would be advantageous. As an alternative approach, we show here that DNA-encoded chemistry technology (DEC-Tec) can be used to discover inhibitors of Mpro. An affinity selection of a 4-billion-membered DNA-encoded chemical library (DECL) using Mpro as bait produces novel non-covalent and non-peptide-based small molecule inhibitors of Mpro with low nanomolar Ki values. Furthermore, these compounds demonstrate efficacy against mutant forms of Mpro that have shown resistance to the standard-of-care drug nirmatrelvir.

247,AI-Driven Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Fragment-like Inhibitors with Antiviral Activity In Vitro.,2023 05 08,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and is responsible for the current global pandemic. The viral genome contains 5 major open reading frames of which the largest ORF1ab codes for two polyproteins, pp1ab and pp1a, which are subsequently cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) by two viral cysteine proteases encoded within the polyproteins. The main protease (Mpro, nsp5) cleaves the majority of the nsp's, making it essential for viral replication and has been successfully targeted for the development of antivirals. The first oral Mpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, was approved for treatment of COVID-19 in late December 2021 in combination with ritonavir as Paxlovid. Increasing the arsenal of antivirals and development of protease inhibitors and other antivirals with a varied mode of action remains a priority to reduce the likelihood for resistance emerging. Here, we report results from an artificial intelligence-driven approach followed by in vitro validation, allowing the identification of five fragment-like Mpro inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 1.5 to 241 muM. The three most potent molecules (compounds 818, 737, and 183) were tested against SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro replication in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Compound 818 was active in both cell models with an EC50 value comparable to its measured IC50 value. On the other hand, compounds 737 and 183 were only active in Calu-3, a preclinical model of respiratory cells, showing selective indexes twice as high as those for compound 818. We also show that our in silico methodology was successful in identifying both reversible and covalent inhibitors.

Given the small molecular weights of these fragments, their high binding efficiency in vitro and efficacy in blocking viral replication, these compounds represent good starting points for the development of potent lead molecules targeting the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.",Saramago LC; Santana MV; Gomes BF; Dantas RF; Senger MR; Oliveira Borges PH; Ferreira VNDS; Dos Santos Rosa A; Tucci AR; Dias Miranda M; Lukacik P; Strain-Damerell C; Owen CD; Walsh MA; Ferreira SB; Silva-Junior FP,,,/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00409,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med23&DO=10.1021%2facs.jcim.3c00409,,,,181
147,Molnupiravir and Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19,,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes a major worldwide public health threat and economic burden. The pandemic is still ongoing and the SARS-CoV-2 variants are still emerging constantly, resulting in an urgent demand for new drugs to treat this disease. Molnupiravir, a biological prodrug of NHC (beta-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine), is a novel nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). Molnupiravir showed potent therapeutic and prophylactic activity against multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in animal models. In clinical trials, molnupiravir showed beneficial effects for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with a favorable safety profile. The oral bioavailability and potent antiviral activity of molnupiravir highlight its potential utility as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19. This review presents the research progress of molnupiravir starting with its discovery and synthesis, broad-spectrum antiviral effects, and antiviral mechanism. In addition, the preclinical studies, antiviral resistance, clinical trials, safety, and drug tolerability of molnupiravir are also summarized and discussed, aiming to expand our knowledge on molnupiravir and better deal with the COVID-19 epidemic.Copyright Â© 2022 Tian, Pang, Li, Lou, An, Zhu, Song, Tong, Fan and Fan.",Tian L.; Pang Z.; Li M.; Lou F.; An X.; Zhu S.; Song L.; Tong Y.; Fan H.; Fan J.,,1664-3224 (electronic),/10.3389/fimmu.2022.855496,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffimmu.2022.855496,,,,182
153,Design of novel and highly selective SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,2024 Sep 03,"We have synthesized a novel and highly selective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease peptide mimetic inhibitor mimicking the replicase 1ab recognition sequence -Val-Leu-Gln- and utilizing a cysteine selective acyloxymethyl ketone as the electrophilic warhead to target the active site Cys145. Utilizing a constrained cyclic peptide that locks the conformation between the P3 (Val) and P2 (Leu) residues, we identified a highly selective inhibitor that fills the P2 pocket occupied by the leucine residue sidechain of PF-00835231 and the dimethyl-3-azabicyclo-hexane motif in nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332). This strategy resulted in potent and highly selective Mpro inhibitors without inhibiting essential host cathepsin cysteine or serine proteases. The lead prototype compound 1 (MPro IC50 = 230 +/- 18 nM) also inhibits the replication of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and can synergize at lower concentrations with the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir, to inhibit replication. It also reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-infected Syrian golden hamsters without obvious toxicities, demonstrating in vivo efficacy. This novel lead structure provides the basis for optimization of improved agents targeting evolving SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance that can selectively act on Mpro versus host proteases and are less likely to have off-target effects due to non-specific targeting. Developing inhibitors against the active site of the main protease (Mpro), which is highly conserved across coronaviruses, is expected to impart a higher genetic barrier to evolving SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance. Drugs that selectively inhibit the viral Mpro are less likely to have off-target effects warranting efforts to improve this therapy.",Poli ANR; Tietjen I; Nandwana NK; Cassel J; Messick TE; Register ET; Keeney F; Rajaiah R; Verma AK; Pandey K; Acharya A; Byrareddy SN; Montaner LJ; Salvino JM,,,/10.1128/aac.00562-24,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=medp&DO=10.1128%2faac.00562-24,,,,183

The reason for the periodic increases in morbidity is the emergence and spread of novel genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2. A decrease in the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been reported, especially against Omicron subvariants. There have been reports of a decrease in the efficacy of specific antiviral drugs as a result of mutations in the genes of non-structural proteins. This indicates the urgent need for practical healthcare to constantly monitor pathogen variability and its effect on the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic drugs. As part of this study, we report the results of the continuous monitoring of COVID-19 in Moscow using genetic and virological methods. As a result of this monitoring, we determined the dominant genetic variants and identified the variants that are most widespread, not only in Moscow, but also in other countries. A collection of viruses from more than 500 SARS-CoV-2 isolates has been obtained and characterized. The genetic lines XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.3, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.4, BQ.1.1.45, CH.1.1, and CL.1, representing the greatest concern, were identified among the dominant variants. We studied the in vitro efficacy of mAbs Tixagevimab + Cilgavimab (Evusheld), Sotrovimab, Regdanvimab, Casirivimab + Imdevimab (Ronapreve), and Bebtelovimab, as well as the specific antiviral drugs Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir, against these genetic lines. At the current stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of mAbs developed against early SARS-CoV-2 variants has little prospect.

234,COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment during Omicron BA.5 vs BA.2.12.1 subvariant predominance period.,2022 Aug 06,"Paxlovid was authorized by FDA to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19. In May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network Health Advisory on potential COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment. Since June 2022, Omicron BA.5 has become the dominant subvariant in the US, which is more resistant to neutralizing antibodies than the previous subvariant BA.2.12.1. Questions remain as to how COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment differs between the BA.5 and BA.2.12.1 subvariants. This is a retrospective cohort study of 15,913 patients who contracted COVID-19 between 5/8/2022-7/18/2022 and were prescribed Paxlovid within 5 days of their COVID-19 infection. The study population was divided into 2 cohorts: (1) BA.5 cohort (n=5,161) - contracted COVID-19 during 6/19/22-7/18/22 when BA.5 was the predominant subvariant2. (2) BA.2.12.1 cohort (n=10,752) - contracted COVID-19 during 5/8/22-6/18/22 when the BA.2.12.1 was the predominant subvariant. The risks of both COVID-19 rebound infections and symptoms 2-8 days after Paxlovid treatment were higher in the BA.5 cohort than in the propensity-score matched BA.2.12.1 cohort: rebound infections (Hazard Ratio or HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.66), rebound symptoms (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04-1.68). As SARS-CoV-2 evolves with successive subvariants more evasive to antibodies, continuous vigilant monitoring is necessary for COVID-19 rebounds after Paxlovid treatment and longer time duration of Paxlovid treatment warrants evaluation.",Wang L; Volkow ND; Davis PB; Berger NA; Kaelber DC; Xu R,,,/10.1101/2022.08.04.22278450,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm7&DO=10.1101%2f2022.08.04.22278450,,,,185
99,Preparing for the next viral threat with broad-spectrum antivirals,,"There is a large global unmet need for the development of countermeasures to combat hundreds of viruses known to cause human disease and for the establishment of a therapeutic portfolio for future pandemic preparedness. Most approved antiviral therapeutics target proteins encoded by a single virus, providing a narrow spectrum of coverage. This, combined with the slow pace and high cost of drug development, limits the scalability of this direct-acting antiviral (DAA) approach. Here, we summarize progress and challenges in the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that target either viral elements (proteins, genome structures, and lipid envelopes) or cellular proviral factors co-opted by multiple viruses via newly discovered compounds or repurposing of approved drugs. These strategies offer new means for developing therapeutics against both existing and emerging viral threats that complement DAAs.Copyright: Â© 2023, Karim et al.

40,SARS-CoV-2 Virologic Rebound With Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir Therapy,,"Background: Data are conflicting regarding an association between treatment of acute COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (N-R) and virologic rebound (VR). Objective(s): To compare the frequency of VR in patients with and without N-R treatment for acute COVID-19. Design(s): Observational cohort study. Setting(s): Multicenter health care system in Boston, Massachusetts. Participant(s): Ambulatory adults with acute COVID-19 with and without use of N-R. Intervention(s): Receipt of 5 days of N-R treatment versus no COVID-19 therapy. Measurements: The primary outcome was VR, defined as either a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral culture result after a prior negative result or 2 consecutive viral loads above 4.0 log10 copies/mL that were also at least 1.0 log10 copies/mL higher than a prior viral load below 4.0 log10 copies/mL. Result(s): Compared with untreated persons (n 1/4 55), those taking N-R (n 1/4 72) were older, received more COVID-19 vaccinations, and more commonly had immunosuppression. Fifteen participants (20.8%) taking N-R had VR versus 1 (1.8%) who was untreated (absolute difference, 19.0 percentage points [95% CI, 9.0 to 29.0 percentage points]; P 1/4 0.001). All persons with VR had a positive viral culture result after a prior negative result. In multivariable models, only N-R use was associated with VR (adjusted odds ratio, 10.02 [CI, 1.13 to 88.74]; P 1/4 0.038). Virologic rebound was more common among those who started therapy within 2 days of symptom onset (26.3%) than among those who started 2 or more days after symptom onset (0%) (P 1/4 0.030). Among participants receiving N-R, those who had VR had prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus compared with those who did not have VR (median, 14 vs. 3 days). Eight of 16 participants (50% [CI, 25% to 75%]) with VR also reported symptom rebound; 2 were completely asymptomatic. No post-VR resistance mutations were detected. Limitation(s): Observational study design with differences between the treated and untreated groups; positive viral culture result was used as a surrogate marker for risk for ongoing viral transmission. Conclusion(s): Virologic rebound occurred in approximately 1 in 5 people taking N-R, often without symptom rebound, and was associated with shedding of replication-competent virus.

12,Anthracyclines inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection,,"Vaccines and drugs are two effective medical interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, remdesivir, paxlovid, and molnupiravir, have been approved for treating COVID-19 patients, but more are needed, because each drug has its limitation of usage and SARS-CoV-2 constantly develops drug resistance mutations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 drugs have the potential to be repurposed to inhibit new human coronaviruses, thus help to prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks. We have screened a library of microbial metabolites to discover new SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To facilitate this screening effort, we generated a recombinant SARSCoV-2 Delta variant carrying the nano luciferase as a reporter for measuring viral infection. Six compounds were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) below 1 muM, including the anthracycline drug aclarubicin that markedly reduced viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-mediated gene expression, whereas other anthracyclines inhibited SARS-CoV-2 by activating the expression of interferon and antiviral genes. As the most commonly prescribed anti-cancer drugs, anthracyclines hold the promise of becoming new SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

163,Therapeutic developments for SARS-CoV-2 infection-Molecular mechanisms of action of antivirals and strategies for mitigating resistance in emerging variants in clinical practice.,2023,"This article systematically presents the current clinically significant therapeutic developments for the treatment of COVID-19 by providing an in-depth review of molecular mechanisms of action for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and critically analyzing the potential targets that may allow the selection of resistant viral variants. Two main categories of agents can display antiviral activity: direct-acting antivirals, which act by inhibiting viral enzymes, and host-directed antivirals, which target host cell factors that are involved in steps of the viral life cycle. We discuss both these types of antivirals, highlighting the agents that have already been approved for treatment of COVID-19, and providing an overview of the main molecules that are currently in drug development. Direct-acting antivirals target viral enzymes that are essential in the viral life cycle. Three direct-acting antivirals are currently in use: two are nucleoside analogs that inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., remdesivir and molnupiravir, and the third one, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The potential for induction of viral resistance is discussed for each of these antivirals, along with their clinical activity on each of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and sublineages that have been dominant over the course of the pandemic, i.e., Alpha, Delta, as well as Omicron and its sublineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1 and XBB. Host-directed antivirals are currently in preclinical or clinical development; these agents target host cell enzymes that are involved in facilitating viral entry, replication, or virion release. By blocking these enzymes, viral replication can theoretically be effectively stopped. As no SARS-CoV-2 host-directed antiviral has been approved so far, further research is still needed and we present the host-directed antivirals that are currently in the pipeline. Another specific type of agents that have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 are neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Their main binding site is the spike protein, and therefore their neutralization activity is influenced by mutations occurring in this region. We discuss the main changes in neutralization activity of NAbs for the most important dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Close monitoring of emerging variants and sublineages is still warranted, to better understand the impact of viral mutations on the clinical efficiency of antivirals and neutralizing antibodies developed for the treatment of COVID-19.

58,Alterations of SARS-CoV-2 Evolutionary Dynamics by Pharmaceutical Factors,,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been influenced by the human response to the virus. These responses have undoubtedly impacted the evolutionary dynamics of the virus in ways distinct from a scenario lacking a widespread response. Two important pharmaceutical interventions, vaccination and the utilization of medications, particularly molnupiravir, known to have mutagenic properties, were the focus of this article. The impact of molnupiravir on human health was evaluated through 3 mechanisms: viral resistance, mutagenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and mutagenesis occurring in patients undergoing treatment with molnupiravir. These mechanisms, as well as the impact of vaccination, have inadvertently given rise to unforeseen challenges in the management of the COVID-19 crisis. Taking a systems view in future pandemic responses, and taking into account the evolution of the pandemic virus, may be critical to ending the pandemic at an earlier date.Copyright Â© 2024 The Chinese Medical Association, published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Halma M.,,2096-9511,/10.1097/ID9.0000000000000103,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1097%2fID9.0000000000000103,,,,192
192,Emerging data in COVID-19 create urgent challengers for health providers: Updates on COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid.,2024 Apr,"In this original research we present new emerging data in COVID-19 that create urgent challenges for health providers in prevention and treatment. Health providers should be aware that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have increased markedly in August 2023. Further, recent data demonstrate a new emerging strain resistant to prior natural and vaccine immunity. The most recent emerging data show that only this updated COVID-19 vaccine produces the same immune response as previous vaccines that reduced mortality by over 95% and morbidity by over 99%. This recommendation encompasses all adults and children aged 6 months and older, regardless of whether they have had a prior COVID-19 infection or even if they have never received a prior vaccination. This updated COVID-19 vaccine, approved in September 2023, will be the best means to prevent COVID-19 during this upcoming season of respiratory viruses. In the meanwhile, all members of the US population regardless of previous natural infection, vaccines, or boosters are equally susceptible. At present, health providers should counsel all their patients about masking, social distancing, and avoiding crowds, especially indoors where regions of extreme weather conditions are keeping people indoors in closed quarters. In the treatment of COVID-19 the major clinical challenge to health providers, especially in their Black patients, is to prescribe Paxlovid during the first 5 days after onset of symptoms and a positive test.

229,Combination of the parent analogue of remdesivir (GS-441524) and molnupiravir results in a markedly potent antiviral effect in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters.,2022,"Remdesivir was the first antiviral drug to be approved for the treatment of severe COVID-19; followed by molnupiravir (another prodrug of a nucleoside analogue) and the protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir. Combination of antiviral drugs may result in improved potency and help to avoid or delay the development of resistant variants. We set out to explore the combined antiviral potency of GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of remdesivir) and molnupiravir against SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV-2 (BA.5) infected A549-Dual TM hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, the combination resulted in an overall additive antiviral effect with a synergism at certain concentrations. Next, the combined effect was explored in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Beta, B.1.351); treatment was started at the time of infection and continued twice daily for four consecutive days. At day 4 post-infection, GS-441524 (50 mg/kg, oral BID) and molnupiravir (150 mg/kg, oral BID) as monotherapy reduced infectious viral loads by 0.5 and 1.6 log10, respectively, compared to the vehicle control. When GS-441524 (50 mg/kg, BID) and molnupiravir (150 mg/kg, BID) were combined, infectious virus was no longer detectable in the lungs of 7 out of 10 of the treated hamsters (4.0 log10 reduction) and titers in the other animals were reduced by ~2 log10. The combined antiviral activity of molnupiravir which acts by inducing lethal mutagenesis and GS-441524, which acts as a chain termination appears to be highly effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication/infectivity. The unexpected potent antiviral effect of the combination warrants further exploration as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

95,Genetic conservation across SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins - Insights into possible targets for treatment of future viral outbreaks,,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development work has focussed on targeting the spike protein, viral polymerase and proteases. As the pandemic progressed, many studies reported that these proteins are prone to high levels of mutation and can become drug resistant. Thus, it is necessary to not only target other viral proteins such as the non-structural proteins (NSPs) but to also target the most conserved residues of these proteins. In order to understand the level of conservation among these viruses, in this review, we have focussed on the conservation across RNA viruses, conservation across the coronaviruses and then narrowed our focus to conservation of NSPs across coronaviruses. We have also discussed the various treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A synergistic melding of bioinformatics, computer-aided drug-design and in vitro/vivo studies can feed into better understanding of the virus and therefore help in the development of small molecule inhibitors against the viral proteins.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors",Kandwal S.; Fayne D.,,0042-6822,/10.1016/j.virol.2023.02.011,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.virol.2023.02.011,,,,196
213,In vitro and in vivo characterization of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to ensitrelvir.,2023 07 15,"Ensitrelvir, an oral antiviral agent that targets a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro or Nsp5), is clinically useful against SARS-CoV-2 including its omicron variants. Since most omicron subvariants have reduced sensitivity to most monoclonal antibody therapies, SARS-CoV-2 resistance to other antivirals including main protease inhibitors such as ensitrelvir is a major public health concern. Here, repeating passages of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of ensitrelvir revealed that the M49L and E166A substitutions in Nsp5 are responsible for reduced sensitivity to ensitrelvir. Both substitutions reduced in vitro virus growth in the absence of ensitrelvir. The combination of the M49L and E166A substitutions allowed the virus to largely evade the suppressive effect of ensitrelvir in vitro. The virus possessing Nsp5-M49L showed similar pathogenicity to wild-type virus, whereas the virus possessing Nsp5-E166A or Nsp5-M49L/E166A slightly attenuated. Ensitrelvir treatment of hamsters infected with the virus possessing Nsp5-M49L/E166A was ineffective; however, nirmatrelvir or molnupiravir treatment was effective. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor the emergence of ensitrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants to guide antiviral treatment selection. Copyright Â© 2023.

We initially developed a DNA vector-based replicon system utilizing the CMV promoter to generate a recombinant viral genome bearing reporter genes. However, this system frequently resulted in drug resistance and cytotoxicity, impeding model establishment. Herein, we present a novel cell culture model with SARS-CoV-2 replication induced by Cre/LoxP-mediated DNA recombination. An engineered SARS-CoV-2 transcription unit was subcloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector. To enhance biosafety, the viral spike protein gene was deleted, and the nucleocapsid gene was replaced with a reporter gene. An exogenous sequence was inserted within NSP1 as a modulatory cassette that is removable after Cre/LoxP-mediated DNA recombination and subsequent RNA splicing. Using the PiggyBac transposon strategy, the transcription unit was integrated into host cell chromatin, yielding a stable cell line capable of inducing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication. The model exhibited sensitivity to the potential antivirals forsythoside A and verteporfin. An innovative inducible SARS-CoV-2 replicon cell model was introduced to further explore the replication and pathogenesis of the virus and facilitate screening and assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.Copyright Â© 2024 by the authors.",Wang X.; Zhu Y.; Wu Q.; Jiang N.; Xie Y.; Deng Q.,,1999-4915 (electronic),/10.3390/v16050708,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3390%2fv16050708,,,,198
136,Cell culture models for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and systemic complications,,"COVID-19 was declared by WHO as a pandemic since March 2020. The vaccination program has been implemented worldwide. Specific antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir and ritonavir-based nirmatrelvir were effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been elevated due to viral mutation causing vaccine resistance and rapid spreading. Long-term COVID-19 complications have been lifethreatening in some recovery cases. To overcome viral adaptation, cell culture model is essential to comprehend SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathophysiology, complications, and drug target alterations. The classical 2D culture cell was frequency used for viral propagation and high-throughput screening. Modern 3D culture has recapitulated key cellular and molecular events of tissue physiology. Here, we reviewed the cell lines, 3D culture, organoid and relevant models for the aforementioned applications.Copyright Â© 2022. by Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Thailand is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

25,Identification of a Papain-Like Protease Inhibitor with Potential for Repurposing in Combination with an MproProtease Inhibitor for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2,,"SARS-CoV-2 requires two cysteine proteases for viral polypeptide processing to allow maturation and replication: the 3C-like protease also known as the Main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). In addition to its critical role in viral replication, PLproremoves post-translational modifications like ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from host proteins through its deubiquitinase domain, leading to host immunosuppression and increased ability of the virus to evade the host antiviral immune response. Through screening of a custom clinical compound library, we identified eltrombopag (DDL-701), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, as having PLproinhibitory activity that is sustained in the presence of the Mproinhibitor nirmatrelvir. DDL-701 also suppressed both the deubiquitinase and ISG15 cleavage activities of PLpro. In addition, DDL-701 partially restored interferon-beta induction - an element of the host immune response - in an in vitro model system. Further, modeling and docking studies suggest DDL-701 interacts with the active site region of the PLproenzyme and pilot pharmacokinetic studies indicate it is brain permeable. DDL-701 is already approved for treatment of thrombocytopenia and has previously been shown to achieve human plasma levels after oral dosing that is above the IC50needed for it to exert its PLproinhibitory activity in vivo. In addition, it has also been reported to have antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. DDL-701 thus represents a drug that can immediately be repurposed and undergo clinical evaluation as a PLproinhibitor that may be most effectively used in a protease inhibitor cocktail with an Mproinhibitor such as nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of COVID-19.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

23,Synergism of interferon-beta with antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 variants,,"Omicron BA.1 variant isolates were previously shown to replicate less effectively in interferon-competent cells and to be more sensitive to interferon treatment than a Delta isolate. Here, an Omicron BA.2 isolate displayed intermediate replication patterns in interferon-competent Caco-2-F03 cells when compared to BA.1 and Delta isolates. Moreover, BA.2 was less sensitive than BA.1 and similarly sensitive as Delta to betaferon treatment. Delta and BA.1 displayed similar sensitivity to the approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, EIDD-1931 (the active metabolite of molnupiravir) and the protease inhibitor aprotinin, whereas BA.2 was less sensitive than Delta and BA.1 to EIDD-1931, nirmatrelvir and aprotinin. Nirmatrelvir, EIDD-1931, and aprotinin (but not remdesivir) exerted synergistic antiviral activity in combination with betaferon, with some differences in the extent of synergism detected between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants. In conclusion, even closely related SARS-CoV-2 (sub)variants can differ in their biology and in their response to antiviral treatments. Betaferon combinations with nirmatrelvir and, in particular, with EIDD-1931 and aprotinin displayed high levels of synergism, which makes them strong candidates for clinical testing. Notably, effective antiviral combination therapies are desirable, as a higher efficacy is expected to reduce resistance formation.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

26,Nirmatrelvir Resistant SARS-CoV-2 Variants with High Fitness in Vitro,,"The oral protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir is expected to play a pivotal role for prevention of severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To facilitate monitoring of potentially emerging resistance, we studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) escape from nirmatrelvir. Resistant variants selected in cell culture harbored different combinations of substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Reverse genetic studies in a homologous infectious cell culture system revealed up to 80-fold resistance conferred by the combination of substitutions L50F and E166V. Resistant variants had high fitness increasing the likelihood of occurrence and spread of resistance. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that E166V and L50F+E166V weakened nirmatrelvir-Mpro binding. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibitor remdesivir retained activity against nirmatrelvir resistant variants and combination of remdesivir and nirmatrelvir enhanced treatment efficacy compared to individual compounds. These findings have implications for monitoring and ensuring treatment programs with high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially emerging coronaviruses.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

114,Virus Infection and Systemic Inflammation: Lessons Learnt from COVID-19 and Beyond,,"Respiratory infections with newly emerging zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, often lead to the perturbation of the human innate and adaptive immune responses causing severe disease with high mortality. The responsible mechanisms are commonly virus-specific and often include either over-activated or delayed local interferon responses, which facilitate efficient viral replication in the primary target organ, systemic viral spread, and rapid onset of organ-specific and harmful inflammatory responses. Despite the distinct replication strategies, human infections with SARS-CoV-2 and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses demonstrate remarkable similarities and differences regarding the mechanisms of immune induction, disease dynamics, as well as the long-term sequelae, which will be discussed in this review. In addition, we will highlight some important lessons about the effectiveness of antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies that this pandemic has taught us.Copyright Â© 2022 by the authors.",Faist A.; Janowski J.; Kumar S.; Hinse S.; Caliskan D.M.; Lange J.; Ludwig S.; Brunotte L.,,2073-4409 (electronic),/10.3390/cells11142198,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3390%2fcells11142198,,,,203

214,Assessment of the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escape from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors and 3C-like protease inhibitors.,2023 08,"The emergence and spread of antiviral-resistant SARS-CoV-2 is of great concern. In this study, we evaluated the propensity of Omicron variants to escape from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitors and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants were serially passaged in vitro in the presence of RdRP inhibitors (remdesivir and molnupiravir) and 3CLpro inhibitors (nirmatrelvir and lufotrelvir) to detect SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. After five passages with 3CLpro inhibitors, mutant viruses that escaped from 3CLpro inhibitors emerged; however, in the presence of RdRP inhibitors all variants disappeared within 2-4 passages. Our findings suggest that the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutant escape from RdRP inhibitors is lower than that from 3CLpro inhibitors. We also found that Delta variants were more likely to acquire amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors under the selective pressure of this drug compared with Omicron variants.

17,Combination of the parent analogue of Remdesivir (GS-441524) and Molnupiravir results in a markedly potent antiviral effect in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters,,"Remdesivir was the first drug to be approved for the treatment of severe COVID-19; followed by molnupiravir (another prodrug of a nucleoside analogue) and the protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir. Combination of antiviral drugs may result in improved potency and help to avoid or delay the development of resistant variants. We set out to explore the combined antiviral potency of GS-441524 (the parent nucleoside of remdesivir) and molnupiravir against SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV-2 (BA.5) infected A549-DualTM hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, the combination resulted in an overall additive antiviral effect with a synergism at certain concentrations. Next, the combined effect was explored in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Beta, B.1.351); treatment was started at the time of infection and continued twice daily for four consecutive days. At 4 day 4 post-infection, GS-441524 (50 mg/kg, oral BID) and molnupiravir (150 mg/kg, oral BID) as monotherapy reduced infectious viral loads by 0.5 and 1.6 log10, respectively, compared to the vehicle control. When GS-441524 (50 mg/kg, BID) and molnupiravir (150 mg/kg, BID) were combined, infectious virus was no longer detectable in the lungs of 7 out of 10 of the treated hamsters (4.0 log10 reduction) and titers in the other animals were reduced by ~2 log10. The combined antiviral activity of molnupiravir which acts by inducing lethal mutagenesis and GS-441524, which acts as a chain termination appears to be highly effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication/infectivity. The unexpected potent antiviral effect of the combination warrants further exploration as a potential treatment for COVID-19.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

8,Discovery and characterization of highly potent and selective covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro,,"Coronavirus infections, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, have had a profound impact on many aspects of our daily life including working style, economy, and the healthcare system. To prevent the rapid viral transmission and speed up recovery from the infection, many academic organizations and industry research labs have conducted extensive research on discovering new therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2. Among those efforts, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors such as Remdesivir, Molnupiravir and 3CLpro inhibitor such as Nirmatrelvir (PaxlovidTM) have been widely used as the therapeutic options. Given the recent emergence of several new variants that caused a resurgence of the virus, it would be beneficial to discover more diverse therapeutic options with novel anti-viral mechanisms. In this regard, PLpro has been highlighted since it, along with 3CLpro, is one of the two most important proteases that are required for SARS-CoV-2 viral processing. While 3CLpro inhibitors were extensively investigated in the light of Emergency Use Authorizations of Nirmatrelvir, PLpro inhibitors have not been thoroughly investigated even preclinically. Thus, discovery efforts on antivirals acting against PLpro will be valuable. PLpro inhibitors may exert their activity by inhibiting viral replication and enhancing the host defense system through blocking virus-induced cell signaling events for evading host immune response. In this study, we report the discovery and development of two covalent irreversible PLpro inhibitors, HUP0109 and its deuterated analog DX-027, out of our quest for novel anti-COVID 19 therapeutic agents for the past two and half years. HUP0109 selectively targets the viral catalytic cleft of PLpro and covalently modifies its active site cysteine residue (C111). Promising results from preclinical evaluation suggest that DX-027 can be developed as a potential COVID-19 treatment.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

16,"The substitutions L50F, E166A and L167F in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro are selected by a protease inhibitor in vitro and confer resistance to nirmatrelvir",,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) has an indispensable role in the viral life cycle and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. The potential of 3CLpro-inhibitors to select for drug-resistant variants needs to be established. Therefore SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161, a probe compound designed in the context of a 3CLpro drug discovery program. We identified a combination of amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) that is associated with > 20x increase in EC50 values for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) and PF-00835231. While two of the single substitutions (E166A and L167F) provide low-level resistance to the inhibitors in a biochemical assay, the triple mutant results in the highest levels of resistance (6- to 72-fold). All substitutions are associated with a significant loss of enzymatic 3CLpro activity, suggesting a reduction in viral fitness. Structural biology analysis indicates that the different substitutions reduce the number of inhibitor/enzyme interactions while the binding of the substrate is maintained. These observations will be important for the interpretation of resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors in the clinical setting.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

266,Editorial: Rebound COVID-19 and Cessation of Antiviral Treatment for SARS-CoV-2 with Paxlovid and Molnupiravir.,2022 Oct 01,"One of the most recently described clinical associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection is rebound COVID-19, which occurs between five and eight days following the cessation of antiviral treatment. Most case reports of rebound COVID-19 have been associated with cessation of treatment with the combined oral antiviral agent nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). On 24 May 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory update for patients, healthcare providers, and public health departments on COVID-19 rebound or recurrence of COVID-19. However, population data from the US showed no significant differences in the risk of developing rebound COVID-19 between patients treated with Paxlovid and Molnupiravir. The mechanisms of rebound COVID-19 remain unclear but may involve the development of resistance to the antiviral drug, impaired immunity to the virus, or insufficient drug dosing. A further explanation may be the persistence of a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who are no longer symptomatic. This Editorial aims to provide an update on what is known about rebound COVID-19 and the current public health implications.",Parums DV,,,/10.12659/MSM.938532,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.12659%2fMSM.938532,,,,211
257,Combinations of Host- and Virus-Targeting Antiviral Drugs Confer Synergistic Suppression of SARS-CoV-2.,2022 10 26,"Three directly acting antivirals (DAAs) demonstrated substantial reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in clinical trials. However, these agents did not completely prevent severe illness and are associated with cases of rebound illness and viral shedding. Combination regimens can enhance antiviral potency, reduce the emergence of drug-resistant variants, and lower the dose of each component in the combination. Concurrently targeting virus entry and virus replication offers opportunities to discover synergistic drug combinations. While combination antiviral drug treatments are standard for chronic RNA virus infections, no antiviral combination therapy has been approved for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we demonstrate that combining host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) that target TMPRSS2 and hence SARS-CoV-2 entry, with the DAA molnupiravir, which targets SARS-CoV-2 replication, synergistically suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells. Strong synergy was observed when molnupiravir, an oral drug, was combined with three TMPRSS2 (HTA) oral or inhaled inhibitors: camostat, avoralstat, or nafamostat. The combination of camostat plus molnupiravir was also effective against the beta and delta variants of concern. The pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor brequinar combined with molnupiravir also conferred robust synergistic inhibition. These HTA+DAA combinations had similar potency to the synergistic all-DAA combination of molnupiravir plus nirmatrelvir, the protease inhibitor found in paxlovid. Pharmacodynamic modeling allowed estimates of antiviral potency at all possible concentrations of each agent within plausible therapeutic ranges, suggesting possible in vivo efficacy. The triple combination of camostat, brequinar, and molnupiravir further increased antiviral potency. These findings support the development of HTA+DAA combinations for pandemic response and preparedness. IMPORTANCE Imagine a future viral pandemic where if you test positive for the new virus, you can quickly take some medicines at home for a few days so that you do not get too sick. To date, only single drugs have been approved for outpatient use against SARS-CoV-2, and we are learning that these have some limitations and may succumb to drug resistance. Here, we show that combinations of two oral drugs are better than the single ones in blocking SARS-CoV-2, and we use mathematical modeling to show that these drug combinations are likely to work in people. We also show that a combination of three oral drugs works even better at eradicating the virus. Our findings therefore bode well for the development of oral drug cocktails for at home use at the first sign of an infection by a coronavirus or other emerging viral pathogens.",Wagoner J; Herring S; Hsiang TY; Ianevski A; Biering SB; Xu S; Hoffmann M; Pohlmann S; Gale M Jr; Aittokallio T; Schiffer JT; White JM; Polyak SJ,,,/10.1128/spectrum.03331-22,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.1128%2fspectrum.03331-22,,,,212
53,A Short Update on the Use of Monoclonal Antibodies in COVID-19,,"Monoclonal antibodies in the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 have been crucial in reducing severe infections when vaccines were unavailable. However, as the virus and its variants have changed over time, the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies has been questioned. This technical note highlights the need to assess the antiviral activity of these antibodies against new variants and adapt treatment strategies accordingly. On the one hand, in vitro studies have suggested reduced susceptibility of the latest variants to monoclonal antibodies, whereas clinical data still show benefits in reducing severe illness and mortality, indicating that laboratory results do not always mirror real-world outcomes. As a result, although resistance to monoclonal antibodies can develop over time, they could still have an important role in COVID-19 treatment, especially when used in combination, and ongoing research aims to identify effective antibodies against new variants.Copyright Â© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2024.",Vitiello A.; Sabbatucci M.; Ponzo A.; Salzano A.; Zovi A.,,1550-7416 (electronic),/10.1208/s12248-024-00904-y,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1208%2fs12248-024-00904-y,,,,213
125,Antiviral Drug Discovery for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infections,,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a recently emerged human coronavirus. COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be successful in protecting the vaccinated from infection, reducing the severity of disease, and deterring the transmission of infection. However, COVID-19 vaccination faces many challenges, such as the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time, and the decrease in potency against some SARS-CoV-2 variants including the recently emerged Omicron variant, resulting in breakthrough infections. The challenges that COVID-19 vaccination is facing highlight the importance of the discovery of antivirals to serve as another means to tackle the pandemic. To date, neutralizing antibodies that block viral entry by targeting the viral spike protein make up the largest class of antivirals that has received US FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 treatment. In addition to the spike protein, other key targets for the discovery of direct-acting antivirals include viral enzymes that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and proteases, as judged by US FDA approval for remdesivir, and EUA for Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir + ritonavir) for treating COVID-19 infections. This review presents an overview of the current status and future direction of antiviral drug discovery for treating SARS-CoV-2 infec-tions, covering important antiviral targets such as the viral spike protein, non-structural protein (nsp) 3 papain-like protease, nsp5 main protease, and the nsp12/nsp7/nsp8 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex.Copyright Â© 2022 by the authors.

120,Genotypic and predicted phenotypic analysis of SARS-COV-2 Omicron subvariants in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 following tixagevimab-cilgavimab prophylaxis,,"Background: Tixagevimab-cilgavimab is used for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, though in vitro data has shown reduced neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Method(s): We performed genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 following tixagevimab-cilgavimab. Resistance-associated substitutions were used to generate a predicted phenotypic susceptibility analysis to tixagevimab-cilgavimab and bebtelovimab. Clinical data collected from these patients included SARS-CoV-2 immunization status, COVID-19-directed therapies, and outcomes. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed in 25 patients. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 was the most common identified subvariant. All patients had viral isolates with spike codon substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to tixagevimab-cilgavimab; their predicted phenotypic analysis showed a >2-fold reduced susceptibility to tixagevimab-cilgavimab. Two patients had viral isolates with spike codon substitutions (K444N and G446D) associated with highly reduced susceptibility to bebtelovimab, although all the viral isolates had <2-fold reduced susceptibility based on predicted phenotypic analysis. Sixteen patients received rescue therapy with bebtelovimab, but one patient with BA.2 subvariant harboring K444N mutation died of COVID-19-related complications. Five patients received other COVID-19 therapies and survived. Four had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 with an uncomplicated course despite not receiving any additional therapy. Discussion(s): Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike codon substitutions that correlated with reduced susceptibility to tixagevimab-cilgavimab were identified in patients with COVID-19 after receiving this monoclonal antibody. Most patients had an uncomplicated course. The identification of spike codon substitutions conferring resistance to bebtelovimab highlights the importance of performing genomic surveillance to identify new resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Ordaya E.E.; Vergidis P.; Razonable R.R.; Yao J.D.; Beam E.,,1386-6532,/10.1016/j.jcv.2023.105382,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.jcv.2023.105382,0,1,,215

87,Combined computational study of the binding of nirmatrelvir to SARS-CoV-2 main protease: insight into resistance mechanism,,"To treat the COVID-19 disease in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected individuals, Pfizer has developed Paxlovid, an antiviral combination that includes nirmatrelvir, a covalent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Recent experimental studies have shown how mutations may lead to the emergence of resistance of Mpro against nirmatrelvir. The aim of our study was to model the reaction of Mpro with a substrate and with the inhibitor, as well as to study the molecular background of resistance development. Multiple crystal structures were analyzed to map the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor interactions, while the conformational space and non-covalent interactions were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. In order to compare the substrate cleavage and nirmatrelvir binding, we have applied the hybrid QM/MM ONIOM method. To examine the resistance, we have modelled previously described resistant variants as well as novel, computationally generated mutants. Our results help better understanding how individual residues of Mpro contribute to substrate cleavage and inhibitor binding at atomic level. We propose how individual mutations of the active site may lead to the development of resistance against nirmatrelvir.",Hoffka G.; Mahdi M.; Tozser J.; Motyan J.A.,,1432-1017,/10.1007/s00249-023-01668-7,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1007%2fs00249-023-01668-7,0,0,,219

Nirmatrelvir is the first protease inhibitor specifically developed against the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro that has been licensed for clinical use. To identify mutations that confer resistance to this protease inhibitor, we engineered a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expressed a polyprotein composed of the VSV glycoprotein (G), the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, and the VSV polymerase (L). Viral replication was thus dependent on the autocatalytic processing of this precursor protein by 3CLpro and release of the functional viral proteins G and L, and replication of this chimeric VSV was effectively inhibited by nirmatrelvir. Using this system, we applied nirmatrelvir to select for resistance mutations. Resistance was confirmed by retesting nirmatrelvir against the selected mutations in additional VSV-based systems, in an independently developed cellular system, in a biochemical assay, and in a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 system. We demonstrate that some mutants are cross-resistant to ensitrelvir and GC376, whereas others are less resistant to these compounds. Furthermore, we found that most of these resistance mutations already existed in SARS-CoV-2 sequences that have been deposited in the NCBI and GISAID databases, indicating that these mutations were present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.",Heilmann E; Costacurta F; Moghadasi SA; Ye C; Pavan M; Bassani D; Volland A; Ascher C; Weiss AKH; Bante D; Harris RS; Moro S; Rupp B; Martinez-Sobrido L; von Laer D,,,/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq7360,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med23&DO=10.1126%2fscitranslmed.abq7360,0,0,,220
32,"Highly specific SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) mutations against the clinical antiviral ensitrelvir selected in a safe, VSV-based system",,"In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the so far two most effective approved antivirals are the protease inhibitors nirmatrelvir, in combination with ritonavir (Paxlovid) and ensitrelvir (Xocova). However, antivirals and indeed all antimicrobial drugs are sooner or later challenged by resistance mutations. Studying such mutations is essential for treatment decisions and pandemic preparedness. At the same time, generating resistant viruses to assess mutants is controversial, especially with pathogens of pandemic potential like SARS-CoV-2. To circumvent gain-of-function research with non-attenuated SARS-CoV-2, a previously developed safe system based on a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (VSV-Mpro) was used to select mutations against ensitrelvir. Ensitrelvir is clinically especially relevant due to its single-substance formulation, avoiding drug-drug interactions by the co-formulated CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir in Paxlovid. By treating VSV-Mpro with ensitrelvir, highly-specific resistant mutants against this inhibitor were selected, while being still fully or largely susceptible to nirmatrelvir. We then confirmed several ensitrelvir-specific mutants in gold standard enzymatic assays and SARS-CoV-2 replicons. These findings indicate that the two inhibitors can have distinct viral resistance profiles, which could determine treatment decisions.Copyright Â© 2024 The Authors",Rauch S.; Costacurta F.; Schoppe H.; Peng J.-Y.; Bante D.; Erisoez E.E.; Sprenger B.; He X.; Moghadasi S.A.; Krismer L.; Sauerwein A.; Heberle A.; Rabensteiner T.; Wang D.; Naschberger A.; Dunzendorfer-Matt T.; Kaserer T.; von Laer D.; Heilmann E.,,0166-3542,/10.1016/j.antiviral.2024.105969,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.antiviral.2024.105969,0,0,,221

268,"Assessment of a Computational Approach to Predict Drug Resistance Mutations for HIV, HBV and SARS-CoV-2.",2022 Aug 24,"Viral resistance is a worldwide problem mitigating the effectiveness of antiviral drugs. Mutations in the drug-targeting proteins are the primary mechanism for the emergence of drug resistance. It is essential to identify the drug resistance mutations to elucidate the mechanism of resistance and to suggest promising treatment strategies to counter the drug resistance. However, experimental identification of drug resistance mutations is challenging, laborious and time-consuming. Hence, effective and time-saving computational structure-based approaches for predicting drug resistance mutations are essential and are of high interest in drug discovery research. However, these approaches are dependent on accurate estimation of binding free energies which indirectly correlate to the computational cost. Towards this goal, we developed a computational workflow to predict drug resistance mutations for any viral proteins where the structure is known. This approach can qualitatively predict the change in binding free energies due to mutations through residue scanning and Prime MM-GBSA calculations. To test the approach, we predicted resistance mutations in HIV-RT selected by (-)-FTC and demonstrated accurate identification of the clinical mutations. Furthermore, we predicted resistance mutations in HBV core protein for GLP-26 and in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro for nirmatrelvir. Mutagenesis experiments were performed on two predicted resistance and three predicted sensitivity mutations in HBV core protein for GLP-26, corroborating the accuracy of the predictions.",Patel D; Ono SK; Bassit L; Verma K; Amblard F; Schinazi RF,,,/10.3390/molecules27175413,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.3390%2fmolecules27175413,0,0,,224

243,SABRes: in silico detection of drug resistance conferring mutations in subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.,2023 May 08,"The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs increasingly used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections has been recognised as a significant threat to COVID-19 control. In addition, some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern appear to be intrinsically resistant to several classes of these antiviral agents. Therefore, there is a critical need for rapid recognition of clinically relevant polymorphisms in SARS-CoV-2 genomes associated with significant reduction of drug activity in virus neutralisation experiments. Here we present SABRes, a bioinformatic tool, which leverages on expanding public datasets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and allows detection of drug resistance mutations in consensus genomes as well as in viral subpopulations. We have applied SABRes to detect resistance-conferring mutations in 25,197 genomes generated over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Australia and identified 299 genomes containing resistance conferring mutations to the five antiviral therapeutics that retain effectiveness against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 - Sotrovimab, Bebtelovimab, Remdesivir, Nirmatrelvir and Molnupiravir. These genomes accounted for a 1.18% prevalence of resistant isolates discovered by SABRes, including 80 genomes with resistance conferring mutations found in viral subpopulations. Timely recognition of these mutations within subpopulations is critical as these mutations can provide an advantage under selective pressure and presents an important step forward in our ability to monitor SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance.

235,The Functional Landscape of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Protease.,2022 Jul 12,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) as the etiologic agent of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has drastically altered life globally. Numerous efforts have been placed on the development of therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. One particular target is the 3CL protease (3CL pro ), which holds promise as it is essential to the virus and highly conserved among coronaviruses, suggesting that it may be possible to find broad inhibitors that treat not just SARS-CoV-2 but other coronavirus infections as well. While the 3CL protease has been studied by many groups for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, our understanding of its tolerance to mutations is limited, knowledge which is particularly important as 3CL protease inhibitors become utilized clinically. Here, we develop a yeast-based deep mutational scanning approach to systematically profile the activity of all possible single mutants of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , and validate our results both in yeast and in authentic viruses. We reveal that the 3CL pro is highly malleable and is capable of tolerating mutations throughout the protein, including within the substrate binding pocket. Yet, we also identify specific residues that appear immutable for function of the protease, suggesting that these interactions may be novel targets for the design of future 3CL pro inhibitors. Finally, we utilize our screening results as a basis to identify E166V as a resistance-conferring mutation against the therapeutic 3CL pro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, in clinical use. Collectively, the functional map presented herein may serve as a guide for further understanding of the biological properties of the 3CL protease and for drug development for current and future coronavirus pandemics.",Iketani S; Hong SJ; Sheng J; Bahari F; Culbertson B; Atanaki FF; Aditham AK; Kratz AF; Luck MI; Tian R; Goff SP; Montazeri H; Sabo Y; Ho DD; Chavez A,,,/10.1101/2022.06.23.497404,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm7&DO=10.1101%2f2022.06.23.497404,0,0,,230
201,Discovery of Nirmatrelvir Resistance Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro: A Computational-Experimental Approach.,2023 11 27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the urgency for effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we employed alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) alanine scanning to identify nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations within SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. FEP identified several mutations, which were validated through in vitro IC50 experiments and found to result in 8- and 72-fold increases in nirmatrelvir IC50 values. Additionally, we constructed SARS-CoV-2 omicron replicons containing these mutations, and one of the mutants (S144A/E166A) displayed a 20-fold increase in EC50, confirming the role of FEP in identifying drug-resistance mutations. Our findings suggest that FEP can be a valuable tool in proactively monitoring the emergence of resistant strains and guiding the design of future inhibitors with reduced susceptibility to drug resistance.

To keep the emerging variants at bay, including Omicron and subvariants, FDA has approved the antiviral nirmatrelvir for mild-to-moderate and high-risk COVID-19 cases. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 could acquire mutations in its main protease (Mpro) to adapt and develop resistance against nirmatrelvir. Employing a unique high-throughput protein design technique, the hotspot residues, and signatures of adaptation of Mpro having the highest probability of mutating and rendering nirmatrelvir ineffective were identified. Our results show that ~40% of the designed mutations in Mpro already exist in the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and several predicted mutations. Moreover, several high-frequency, designed mutations were found to be in corroboration with the experimentally reported nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants and are naturally occurring. Our work on the targeted design of the nirmatrelvir-binding site offers a comprehensive picture of potential hotspot sites and resistance mutations in Mpro and is thus crucial in comprehending viral adaptation, robust antiviral design, and surveillance of evolving Mpro variations.

82,Frequent Emergence of Resistance Mutations Following Complex Intra-Host Genomic Dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 Patients Receiving Sotrovimab,,"The emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 represented a challenge to the treatment of COVID-19 using monoclonal antibodies. Only Sotrovimab maintained partial activity, allowing it to be used in high-risk patients infected with the Omicron variant. However, reports of resistance mutations to Sotrovimab demand efforts to better understand the intra-patient emergence of Sotrovimab resistance. A retrospective genomic analysis was conducted on respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who received Sotrovimab at our hospital between December 2021 and August 2022. The study involved 95 sequential specimens from 22 patients (1 to 12 samples/patient; 3 to 107 days post-infusion; threshold cycle [CT] # 32). Resistance mutations (in P337, E340, K356, and R346) were detected in 68% of cases; the shortest time to detection of a resistance mutation was 5 days after Sotrovimab infusion. The dynamics of resistance acquisition were highly complex, with up to 11 distinct amino acid changes in specimens from the same patient. In two patients, the mutation distribution was compartmentalized in respiratory samples from different sources. This is the first study to examine the acquisition of Sotrovimab resistance in the BA.5 lineage, enabling us to determine the lack of genomic or clinical differences between Sotrovimab resistance in BA.5 relative to that in BA.1/2. Across all Omicron lineages, the acquisition of resistance delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance (40.67 versus 19.5 days). Close, real-time genomic surveillance of patients receiving Sotrovimab should be mandatory to facilitate early therapeutic interventions.Copyright Â© 2023 American Society for Microbiology.",Palomino-Cabrera R.; Tejerina F.; Molero-Salinas A.; Ferris M.; Veintimilla C.; Catalan P.; Macias G.R.; Alonso R.; Munoz P.; de Viedma D.G.; Perez-Lago L.,,0066-4804,/10.1128/aac.00266-23,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1128%2faac.00266-23,0,0,,233
112,Vaccines and therapeutics for immunocompromised patients with COVID-19,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted immunocompromised patients. This diverse group is at increased risk for impaired vaccine responses, progression to severe disease, prolonged hospitalizations and deaths. At particular risk are people with deficiencies in lymphocyte number or function such as transplant recipients and those with hematologic malignancies. Such patients' immune responses to vaccination and infection are frequently impaired leaving them more vulnerable to prolonged high viral loads and severe complications of COVID-19. Those in turn, have implications for disease progression and persistence, development of immune escape variants and transmission of infection. Data to guide vaccination and treatment approaches in immunocompromised people are generally lacking and extrapolated from other populations. The large clinical trials leading to authorisation and approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics included very few immunocompromised participants.

260,Nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants with high fitness in an infectious cell culture system.,2022 12 21,"The oral protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir is of key importance for prevention of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To facilitate resistance monitoring, we studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) escape from nirmatrelvir in cell culture. Resistant variants harbored combinations of substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Reverse genetics revealed that E166V and L50F + E166V conferred high resistance in infectious culture, replicon, and Mpro systems. While L50F, E166V, and L50F + E166V decreased replication and Mpro activity, L50F and L50F + E166V variants had high fitness in the infectious system. Naturally occurring L50F compensated for fitness cost of E166V and promoted viral escape. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that E166V and L50F + E166V weakened nirmatrelvir-Mpro binding. Polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and monoclonal antibody bebtelovimab retained activity against nirmatrelvir-resistant variants, and combination with nirmatrelvir enhanced treatment efficacy compared to individual compounds.

219,Molecular Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Sub-Lineages Isolated from Turkish Patients Infected with COVID-19.,2023 04 27,"Early detection and characterization of new variants and their impacts enable improved genomic surveillance. This study aims to evaluate the subvariant distribution of Omicron strains isolated from Turkish cases to determine the rate of antiviral resistance of RdRp and 3CLpro inhibitors. The Stanford University Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database online tool was used for variant analyses of the strains uploaded to GISAID as Omicron (n = 20.959) between January 2021 and February,2023. Out of 288 different Omicron subvariants, B.1, BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, BE.1, BF.1, BM.1, BN.1, BQ.1, CK.1, CL.1, and XBB.1 were the main determined subvariants, and BA.1 (34.7%), BA.2 (30.8%), and BA.5 (23.6%) were reported most frequently. RdRp and 3CLPro-related resistance mutations were determined in n = 150, 0.72% sequences, while the rates of resistance against RdRp and 3CLpro inhibitors were reported at 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Mutations that were previously associated with a reduced susceptibility to remdesivir, nirmatrelvir/r, and ensitrelvir were most frequently detected in BA.2 (51.3%). The mutations detected at the highest rate were A449A/D/G/V (10.5%), T21I (10%), and L50L/F/I/V (6%). Our findings suggest that continuous monitoring of variants, due to the diversity of Omicron lineages, is necessary for global risk assessment.

100,Diverse Gene Mutations by Molnupiravir After B-Cell Depletion Therapy: Report of 2 COVID-19 Cases,,"Rationale: Molnupiravir is effective against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing viral RNA mutagenesis but may cause mutant viruses when used in immunosuppressed patients, where the immunity required for virus elimination is not sufficiently induced. Case 1 was a 57-year-old man with follicular lymphoma who had last been treated with obinutuzumab 2 months before COVID-19. Three days after the onset, he was treated with molnupiravir, which resolved the fever; 47 days later, he was hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia (Rt-PCR positive) and was treated with steroids, antiviral drugs (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir), and monoclonal antibodies therapy. 80 days later, pneumonia improved, and the virus became negative. A total of 11 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were determined chronologically using next-generation sequencers from patient saliva samples. A total of 140 bases were mutated with new mutations or spontaneous disappearance during hospitalization, but mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein were consistent after hospitalization. C-to-T and G-to-A mutations were found in 40 and 18 nucleotides, respectively, which molnupiravir could be involved. Case 2 was a 74-year-old man with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who had last been treated with rituximab 7 months before COVID-19. Five days after the onset, he was treated with molnupiravir, which resolved the fever; on day 25, he was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (Rt-PCR positive) with respiratory failure. He was treated as in the above case but died 108 days later of respiratory failure due to ARDS, with concomitant MRSA bacteremia and pulmonary embolism. A total of 9 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were determined chronologically. A total of 121 bases were mutated and mutations were also found in K444M, G446S, G446D, and S477N in the RBD of the spike protein. C-to-T and G-to-A mutations were found in 33 bases in 16 bases, respectively. Discussion(s): Molecular evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated at 23-25 mutations/genome/year when they repeatedly proliferate during an epidemic. However, in the above two cases, multiple mutations appeared and gradually disappeared later at a high frequency, suggesting that the mutations are not stable. In particular, mutations in the RBD region of the spike protein affect therapeutic efficacy. In immunosuppressed patients with prolonged infection, mornupiravir may cause severe mutations for the next variants of SARS-CoV-2.",Masuda T.; Nakayasu H.; Kishimoto Y.; Asada K.; Shirai T.; Ehara K.; Kanazawa Y.; Kuroda M.,,1535-4970,/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2023.B61,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1164%2fajrccm-conference.2023.B61,0,0,,238

207,Molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir.,2023 Oct,"Nirmatrelvir is a specific antiviral drug that targets the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and has been approved to treat COVID-191,2. As an RNA virus characterized by high mutation rates, whether SARS-CoV-2 will develop resistance to nirmatrelvir is a question of concern. Our previous studies have shown that several mutational pathways confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, but some result in a loss of viral replicative fitness, which is then compensated for by additional alterations3. The molecular mechanisms for this observed resistance are unknown. Here we combined biochemical and structural methods to demonstrate that alterations at the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro can allow SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance to nirmatrelvir in two distinct ways. Comprehensive studies of the structures of 14 Mpro mutants in complex with drugs or substrate revealed that alterations at the S1 and S4 subsites substantially decreased the level of inhibitor binding, whereas alterations at the S2 and S4' subsites unexpectedly increased protease activity. Both mechanisms contributed to nirmatrelvir resistance, with the latter compensating for the loss in enzymatic activity of the former, which in turn accounted for the restoration of viral replicative fitness, as observed previously3. Such a profile was also observed for ensitrelvir, another clinically relevant Mpro inhibitor. These results shed light on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evolves to develop resistance to the current generation of protease inhibitors and provide the basis for the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors.

272,Genetic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Reveals High Sequence and Structural Conservation Prior to the Introduction of Protease Inhibitor Paxlovid.,2022 08 30,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to represent a global health emergency as a highly transmissible, airborne virus. An important coronaviral drug target for treatment of COVID-19 is the conserved main protease (Mpro). Nirmatrelvir is a potent Mpro inhibitor and the antiviral component of Paxlovid. The significant viral sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique opportunity to assess potential nirmatrelvir escape mutations from emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. To establish the baseline mutational landscape of Mpro prior to the introduction of Mpro inhibitors, Mpro sequences and its cleavage junction regions were retrieved from ~4,892,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the open-access Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. Any mutations identified from comparison to the reference sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1) were catalogued and analyzed. Mutations at sites key to nirmatrelvir binding and protease functionality (e.g., dimerization sites) were still rare. Structural comparison of Mpro also showed conservation of key nirmatrelvir contact residues across the extended Coronaviridae family (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronaviruses). Additionally, we showed that over time, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme remained under purifying selection and was highly conserved relative to the spike protein. Now, with the emergency use authorization (EUA) of Paxlovid and its expected widespread use across the globe, it is essential to continue large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro evolution. This study establishes a robust analysis framework for monitoring emergent mutations in millions of virus isolates, with the goal of identifying potential resistance to present and future SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. IMPORTANCE The recent authorization of oral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antivirals, such as Paxlovid, has ushered in a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of new variants, as well as the selective pressure imposed by antiviral drugs themselves, raises concern for potential escape mutations in key drug binding motifs. To determine the potential emergence of antiviral resistance in globally circulating isolates and its implications for the clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates before, during, and after the introduction of new antiviral treatments is critical. The infrastructure built herein for active genetic surveillance of Mpro evolution and emergent mutations will play an important role in assessing potential antiviral resistance as the pandemic progresses and Mpro inhibitors are introduced. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point in a larger effort for global monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutational landscape.",Lee JT; Yang Q; Gribenko A; Perrin BS Jr; Zhu Y; Cardin R; Liberator PA; Anderson AS; Hao L,,,/10.1128/mbio.00869-22,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.1128%2fmbio.00869-22,0,0,,242

205,Substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Selected by Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir Confer Resistance to Nirmatrelvir.,2023 09 21,"Nirmatrelvir, which targets the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), is the first-in-line drug for prevention and treatment of severe COVID-19, and additional Mpro inhibitors are in development. However, the risk of resistance development threatens the future efficacy of such direct-acting antivirals. To gain knowledge on viral correlates of resistance to Mpro inhibitors, we selected resistant SARS-CoV-2 under treatment with the nirmatrelvir-related protease inhibitor boceprevir. SARS-CoV-2 selected during five escape experiments in VeroE6 cells showed cross-resistance to nirmatrelvir with up to 7.3-fold increased half-maximal effective concentration compared to original SARS-CoV-2, determined in concentration-response experiments. Sequence analysis revealed that escape viruses harbored Mpro substitutions L50F and A173V. For reverse genetic studies, these substitutions were introduced into a cell-culture-infectious SARS-CoV-2 clone. Infectivity titration and analysis of genetic stability of cell-culture-derived engineered SARS-CoV-2 mutants showed that L50F rescued the fitness cost conferred by A173V. In the concentration-response experiments, A173V was the main driver of resistance to boceprevir and nirmatrelvir. Structural analysis of Mpro suggested that A173V can cause resistance by making boceprevir and nirmatrelvir binding less favorable. This study contributes to a comprehensive overview of the resistance profile of the first-in-line COVID-19 treatment nirmatrelvir and can thus inform population monitoring and contribute to pandemic preparedness.",Gammeltoft KA; Zhou Y; Ryberg LA; Pham LV; Binderup A; Hernandez CRD; Offersgaard A; Fahnoe U; Peters GHJ; Ramirez S; Bukh J; Gottwein JM,,,/10.3390/v15091970,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.3390%2fv15091970,0,0,,246
15,Antiviral treatments lead to the rapid accrual of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in immunocompromised patients,,"The antiviral Molnupiravir (Lageviro) is widely used across the world to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molnupiravir reduces viral replication by inducing mutations throughout the genome, yet in patients that do not clear the infection, the longer-term impact of the drug on virus evolution is unclear. Here, we used a case-control approach to monitor SARS-CoV-2 genomes through time in nine immunocompromised -patients with five treated with Molnupiravir. Within days of treatment, we detected a large number of low-frequency mutations in patients and that these new mutations could persist and, in some cases, were fixed in the virus population. All patients treated with the drug accrued new mutations in the spike protein of the virus, including non-synonymous mutations that altered the amino acid sequence. Our study demonstrates that this commonly used antiviral can 'supercharge' viral evolution in immunocompromised patients, potentially generating new variants and prolonging the pandemic.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

103,Generation of SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations by monoclonal antibody therapy,,"COVID-19 patients at risk of severe disease may be treated with neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To minimise virus escape from neutralisation these are administered as combinations e.g. casirivimab+imdevimab or, for antibodies targeting relatively conserved regions, individually e.g. sotrovimab. Unprecedented genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK has enabled a genome-first approach to detect emerging drug resistance in Delta and Omicron cases treated with casirivimab+imdevimab and sotrovimab respectively. Mutations occur within the antibody epitopes and for casirivimab+imdevimab multiple mutations are present on contiguous raw reads, simultaneously affecting both components. Using surface plasmon resonance and pseudoviral neutralisation assays we demonstrate these mutations reduce or completely abrogate antibody affinity and neutralising activity, suggesting they are driven by immune evasion. In addition, we show that some mutations also reduce the neutralising activity of vaccine-induced serum.Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s).",Ragonnet-Cronin M.; Nutalai R.; Huo J.; Dijokaite-Guraliuc A.; Das R.; Tuekprakhon A.; Supasa P.; Liu C.; Selvaraj M.; Groves N.; Hartman H.; Ellaby N.; Mark Sutton J.; Bahar M.W.; Zhou D.; Fry E.; Ren J.; Brown C.; Klenerman P.; Dunachie S.J.; Mongkolsapaya J.; Hopkins S.; Chand M.; Stuart D.I.; Screaton G.R.; Rokadiya S.,,2041-1723 (electronic),/10.1038/s41467-023-37826-w,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1038%2fs41467-023-37826-w,0,0,,248
244,Evaluation of antiviral drugs against newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants.,2023 06,"Ongoing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and their rapid worldwide spread pose a threat to public health. From November 2022 to February 2023, newly emerged Omicron subvariants, including BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.5.2, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, and BN.1.9, became prevalent global strains (>5% global prevalence). These Omicron subvariants are resistant to several therapeutic antibodies. Thus, the antiviral activity of current drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, which target highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, against newly emerged Omicron subvariants need to be evaluated. We assessed the antiviral efficacy of the drugs using the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against human isolates of 23 Omicron subvariants and four former SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and compared it with the antiviral efficacy of these drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (hCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). Maximal IC50-fold changes of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir were 1.9 (BA.2.75.2), 1.2 (B.1.627.2), and 1.4 (BA.2.3), respectively, compared to median IC50 values of the reference strain. Moreover, median IC50-fold changes of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir against the Omicron variants were 0.96, 0.4, and 0.62, respectively, similar to the 1.02, 0.88, and 0.67, respectively, median IC50-fold changes for previous VOCs. Although K90R and P132H in Nsp 5, and P323L, A529V, G671S, V405F, and ins823D in Nsp 12 mutations were identified, these amino acid substitutions did not affect drug antiviral activity. These results indicate that current antivirals retain antiviral efficacy against newly emerged Omicron subvariants. It is important to continue active surveillance and testing of new variants for drug resistance to enable early identification of drug-resistant strains. Copyright Â© 2023.

74,Clinical experience of treatment of immunocompromised individuals with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection based on drug resistance mutations determined by genomic analysis: a descriptive study,,"Background: The efficacy of antiviral drugs that neutralize antibody drugs and fight against SARS-COV-2 is reported to be attenuated by genetic mutations of the virus in vitro. When B-cell immunocompromised patients are infected with SARS-COV-2, the infection can be prolonged, and genetic mutations can occur during the course of treatment. Therefore, for refractory patients with persistent COVID-19 infection, genomic analysis was performed to obtain data on drug resistance mutations as a reference to determine which antiviral drugs and antibody therapies might be effective in their treatment. Method(s): This was a descriptive analysis with no controls. Patients were diagnosed as having COVID-19, examined, and treated in the Kansai Medical University General Medical Center between January 2022 and January 2023. The subjects of the study were B-cell immunocompromised patients in whom genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Result(s): During the study period, 984 patients with COVID-19 were treated at our hospital. Of those, 17 refractory cases underwent genomic analysis. All 17 patients had factors related to immunodeficiency, such as malignant lymphoma or post-organ transplantation. Eleven patients started initial treatment for COVID-19 at our hospital, developed persistent infection, and underwent genomic analysis. Six patients who were initially treated for COVID-19 at other hospitals became persistently infected and were transferred to our hospital. Before COVID-19 treatment, genomic analysis showed no intrahost mutations in the NSP5, the NSP12, and the RBD regions. After COVID-19 treatment, mutations in these regions were found in 12 of 17 cases (71%). Sixteen patients survived the quarantine, but one died of sepsis. Conclusion(s): In genomic analysis, more mutations were found to be drug-resistant after COVID-19 treatment than before COVID-19 treatment. Although it was not possible to demonstrate the usefulness of genome analysis for clinical application, the change of the treatment drug with reference to drug resistance indicated by genomic analysis may lead to good outcome of immunocompromised COVID-19 patients.Copyright Â© 2023, The Author(s).",Shimazu H.; Wada D.; Maruyama S.; Inoue A.; Kashihara M.; Yoshihara T.; Saito F.; Yoshiya K.; Nakamori Y.; Kuwagata Y.,,1471-2334 (electronic),/10.1186/s12879-023-08797-6,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1186%2fs12879-023-08797-6,0,0,,250
164,A yeast-based system to study SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure and to identify nirmatrelvir resistant mutations.,2022 Aug 26,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a major therapeutic target. The Mpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, is the antiviral component of Paxlovid, an orally available treatment for COVID-19. As Mpro inhibitor use increases, drug resistant mutations will likely emerge. We have established a non-pathogenic system, in which yeast growth serves as a proxy for Mpro activity, enabling rapid identification of mutants with altered enzymatic activity and drug sensitivity. The E166 residue is known to be a potential hot spot for drug resistance and yeast assays showed that an E166R substitution conferred strong nirmatrelvir resistance while an E166N mutation compromised activity. On the other hand, N142A and P132H mutations caused little to no change in drug response and activity. Standard enzymatic assays confirmed the yeast results. In turn, we solved the structures of Mpro E166R, and Mpro E166N, providing insights into how arginine may drive drug resistance while asparagine leads to reduced activity. The work presented here will help characterize novel resistant variants of Mpro that may arise as Mpro antivirals become more widely used.",Ou J; Lewandowski EM; Hu Y; Lipinski AA; Morgan RT; Jacobs LMC; Zhang X; Bikowitz MJ; Langlais P; Tan H; Wang J; Chen Y; Choy JS,,,/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1942964/v1,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm&DO=10.21203%2frs.3.rs-1942964%2fv1,0,0,,251
215,In vitro and in vivo characterization of SARS-CoV-2 strains resistant to nirmatrelvir.,2023 07 04,"Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral agent that targets a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro), is clinically useful against infection with SARS-CoV-2 including its omicron variants. Since most omicron subvariants have reduced sensitivity to many monoclonal antibody therapies, potential SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir is a major public health concern. Several amino acid substitutions have been identified as being responsible for reduced susceptibility to nirmatrelvir. Among them, we selected L50F/E166V and L50F/E166A/L167F in the 3CLpro because these combinations of substitutions are unlikely to affect virus fitness. We prepared and characterized delta variants possessing Nsp5-L50F/E166V and Nsp5-L50F/E166A/L167F. Both mutant viruses showed decreased susceptibility to nirmatrelvir and their growth in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells was delayed. Both mutant viruses showed attenuated phenotypes in a male hamster infection model, maintained airborne transmissibility, and were outcompeted by wild-type virus in co-infection experiments in the absence of nirmatrelvir, but less so in the presence of the drug. These results suggest that viruses possessing Nsp5-L50F/E166V and Nsp5-L50F/E166A/L167F do not become dominant in nature. However, it is important to closely monitor the emergence of nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants because resistant viruses with additional compensatory mutations could emerge, outcompete the wild-type virus, and become dominant.

However, ongoing virus transmission, continuous evolution, and increasing selective pressures have the potential to yield viral variants capable of resisting these interventions. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of natural variants of the main protease [Mpro; 3C-like protease (3CLpro)] of SARS-CoV-2 to protease inhibitors. Multiple single amino acid changes in Mpro confer resistance to nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid). An additional clinical-stage inhibitor, ensitrelvir (Xocova), shows a different resistance mutation profile. Importantly, phylogenetic analyses indicate that several of these resistant variants have pre-existed the introduction of these drugs into the human population and are capable of spreading.

190,A combination of nirmatrelvir and ombitasvir boosts inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication.,2024 May,"Antiviral therapeutics are highly effective countermeasures for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, development of resistance to antivirals undermines their effectiveness. Combining multiple antivirals during patient treatment has the potential to overcome the evolutionary selective pressure towards antiviral resistance, as well as provide a more robust and efficacious treatment option. The current evidence for effective antiviral combinations to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication is limited. Here, we demonstrate a combination of nirmatrelvir with ombitasvir, to jointly bring about potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. We developed an in vitro 384- well plate cytopathic effect assay for the evaluation of antiviral combinations against Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found, that a combination of ombitasvir and nirmatrelvir was synergistic; thereby decreasing the nirmatrelvir IC50 by approx. 16-fold. The increased potency of the nirmatrelvir-ombitasvir combination, over nirmatrelvir alone afforded a greater than 3 log10 reduction in viral titre, which is sufficient to fully prevent the detection of progeny SARS-CoV-2 viral particles at 48 h post infection. The mechanism of this potentiated effect was shown to be, in-part, due to joint inhibition of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease via a positive allosteric modulation mechanism. Crown Copyright Â© 2024.

4,Contribu)ons of hyperac)ve muta)ons in Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 to drug resistance,,"The appearance and spread of mutaAons that cause drug resistance in rapidly evolving diseases, including infecAons by SARS-CoV-2 virus, are major concerns for human health. Many drugs target enzymes, and resistance-conferring mutaAons impact inhibitor binding and/or enzyme acAvity. Nirmatrelvir, the most widely used inhibitor currently used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infecAons, targets the main protease (Mpro) prevenAng it from processing the viral polyprotein into acAve subunits. Our previous work systemaAcally analyzed resistance mutaAons in Mpro that reduce binding to inhibitors; here we invesAgate mutaAons that affect enzyme funcAon. HyperacAve mutaAons that increase Mpro acAvity can contribute to drug resistance but had not been thoroughly studied. To explore how hyperacAve mutaAons contribute to resistance, we comprehensively assessed how all possible individual mutaAons in Mpro affect enzyme funcAon using a mutaAonal scanning approach with a FRET-based yeast readout. We idenAfied hundreds of mutaAons that significantly increased Mpro acAvity. HyperacAve mutaAons occurred both proximal and distal to the acAve site, consistent with protein stability and/or dynamics impacAng acAvity. HyperacAve mutaAons were observed three Ames more than mutaAons which reduced apparent binding to nirmatrelvir in recent studies of laboratory grown viruses selected for drug resistance. HyperacAve mutaAons were also about three Ames more prevalent than nirmatrelvir-binding mutaAons in sequenced isolates from circulaAng SARS-CoV-2. Our findings indicate that hyperacAve mutaAons are likely to contribute to the natural evoluAon of drug resistance in Mpro and provide a comprehensive list for future surveillance efforts.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

188,Molecular Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and Clinical Manifestations among Organ Transplant Recipients with COVID-19.,2023 12 22,"RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, rely on genetic mutation as a major evolutionary mechanism, leading to the emergence of variants. Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) may be particularly vulnerable to such mutations, making it crucial to monitor the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in this population. This cohort study investigated the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 by comparing the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome, demographic characteristics, clinical conditions, and outcomes of COVID-19 illness among OTRs (n = 19) and non-OTRs with (n = 38) or without (n = 30) comorbid conditions. Most patients without comorbidities were female, whereas most OTRs were male. Age varied significantly among the three groups: patients with comorbidities were the oldest, and patients without comorbidities were the youngest. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that OTRs with mild disease had higher numbers of unusual mutations than patients in the other two groups. Additionally, OTRs who died had similar spike monoclonal antibody resistance mutations and 3CLpro mutations, which may confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, ensitrelvir, and GC37 therapy. The presence of those unusual mutations may impact the severity of COVID-19 illness in OTRs by affecting the virus's ability to evade the immune system or respond to treatment. The higher mutation rate in OTRs may also increase the risk of the emergence of new virus variants. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 in all immunocompromised populations and patients with comorbidity.",Alshukairi AN; Al-Qahtani AA; Obeid DA; Dada A; Almaghrabi RS; Al-Abdulkareem MA; Alahideb BM; Alsanea MS; Alsuwairi FA; Alhamlan FS,,,/10.3390/v16010025,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.3390%2fv16010025,0,0,,258

According to published data, major genetic mutations, differences in clinical severity and also resistance to prevention and treatment strategies have been observed. Lower rates of disease severity, hospital and intensive care unit admissions, younger age of contamination with progression to severe disease, resistance to 2 dose vaccination, risk of re-infection and resistance to monoclonal antibodies have been some of the many differences in the recent variant of concern.

222,Distal Protein-Protein Interactions Contribute to SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Substrate Binding and Nirmatrelvir Resistance.,2024 Apr 02,"SARS-CoV-2 main protease, M pro , is responsible for the processing of the viral polyproteins into individual proteins, including the protease itself. M pro is a key target of anti-COVID-19 therapeutics such as nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid). Resistance mutants identified clinically and in viral passage assays contain a combination of active site mutations (e.g. E166V, E166A, L167F), which reduce inhibitor binding and enzymatic activity, and non-active site mutations (e.g. P252L, T21I, L50F), which restore the fitness of viral replication. Although the mechanism of resistance for the active site mutations is apparent, the role of the non-active site mutations in fitness rescue remains elusive. In this study, we use the model system of a M pro triple mutant (L50F/E166A/L167F) that confers not only nirmatrelvir drug resistance but also a similar fitness of replication compared to the wild-type both in vitro and in vivo. By comparing peptide and full-length M pro protein as substrates, we demonstrate that the binding of M pro substrate involves more than residues in the active site. In particular, L50F and other non-active site mutations can enhance the M pro dimer-dimer interactions and help place the nsp5-6 substrate at the enzyme catalytic center. The structural and enzymatic activity data of M pro L50F, L50F/E166A/L167F, and others underscore the importance of considering the whole substrate protein in studying M pro and substrate interactions, and offers important insights into M pro function, resistance development, and inhibitor design.",Lewandowski EM; Zhang X; Tan H; Jaskolka-Brown A; Kohaal N; Frazier A; Madsen JJ; Jacobs LMC; Wang J; Chen Y,,,/10.1101/2024.04.01.587566,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm9&DO=10.1101%2f2024.04.01.587566,0,0,,262

264,Predicting Antiviral Resistance Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease with Computational and Experimental Screening.,2022 11 15,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral replication and has been the focus of many drug discovery efforts since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nirmatrelvir (NTV) is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that is used in the combination drug Paxlovid for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. However, with increased use of NTV across the globe, there is a possibility that future SARS-CoV-2 lineages will evolve resistance to NTV. Early prediction and monitoring of resistance mutations could allow for measures to slow the spread of resistance and for the development of new compounds with activity against resistant strains. In this work, we have used in silico mutational scanning and inhibitor docking of Mpro to identify potential resistance mutations. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed five mutations (N142L, E166M, Q189E, Q189I, and Q192T) that reduce the potency of NTV and of a previously identified non-covalent cyclic peptide inhibitor of Mpro. The E166M mutation reduced the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NTV 24-fold and 118-fold for the non-covalent peptide inhibitor.

242,Evaluation of the Inhibition Potency of Nirmatrelvir against Main Protease Mutants of SARS-CoV-2 Variants.,2023 07 04,"SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health. Main protease (Mpro) is one of the most lucrative drug targets for developing specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. By targeting Mpro, peptidomimetic nirmatrelvir is able to inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the risk for progression to severe COVID-19. However, multiple mutations in the gene encoding Mpro of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants raise a concern of drug resistance. In the present study, we expressed 16 previously reported SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutants (G15S, T25I, T45I, S46F, S46P, D48N, M49I, L50F, L89F, K90R, P132H, N142S, V186F, R188K, T190I, and A191V). We evaluated the inhibition potency of nirmatrelvir against these Mpro mutants and solved the crystal structures of representative Mpro mutants of SARS-CoV-2 bound to nirmatrelvir. Enzymatic inhibition assays revealed that these Mpro variants remain susceptible to nirmatrelvir as the wildtype. Detailed analysis and structural comparison provided the inhibition mechanism of Mpro mutants by nirmatrelvir.

209,A yeast-based system to study SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure and to identify nirmatrelvir resistant mutations.,2023 08,"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a major therapeutic target. The Mpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir, is the antiviral component of Paxlovid, an orally available treatment for COVID-19. As Mpro inhibitor use increases, drug resistant mutations will likely emerge. We have established a non-pathogenic system, in which yeast growth serves as an approximation for Mpro activity, enabling rapid identification of mutants with altered enzymatic activity and drug sensitivity. The E166 residue is known to be a potential hot spot for drug resistance and yeast assays identified substitutions which conferred strong nirmatrelvir resistance and others that compromised activity. On the other hand, N142A and the P132H mutation, carried by the Omicron variant, caused little to no change in drug response and activity. Standard enzymatic assays confirmed the yeast results. In turn, we solved the structures of Mpro E166R, and Mpro E166N, providing insights into how arginine may drive drug resistance while asparagine leads to reduced activity. The work presented here will help characterize novel resistant variants of Mpro that may arise as Mpro antivirals become more widely used. Copyright: Â© 2023 Ou et al.

28,Genetic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mproreveals high sequence and structural conservation prior to the introduction of protease inhibitor Paxlovid,,"SARS-CoV-2 continues to represent a global health emergency as a highly transmissible, airborne virus. An important coronaviral drug target for treatment of COVID-19 is the conserved main protease (Mpro). Nirmatrelvir is a potent Mproinhibitor and the antiviral component of PaxlovidTM. The significant viral sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique opportunity to assess potential nirmatrelvir escape mutations from emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. To establish the baseline mutational landscape of Mproprior to the introduction of Mproinhibitors, Mprosequences and its cleavage junction regions were retrieved from ~4,892,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID. Any mutations identified from comparison to the reference sequence (Wuhan-hu-1) were cataloged and analyzed. Mutations at sites key to nirmatrelvir binding and protease functionality (e.g., dimerization sites) were still rare. Structural comparison of Mproalso showed conservation of key nirmatrelvir contact residues across the extended Coronaviridae family (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronaviruses). Additionally, we showed that over time the SARS-CoV-2 Mproenzyme remained under purifying selection and was highly conserved relative to the spike protein. Now, with the EUA approval of Paxlovid and its expected widespread use across the globe, it is essential to continue large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mproevolution. This study establishes a robust analysis framework for monitoring emergent mutations in millions of virus isolates, with the goal of identifying potential resistance to present and future SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

206,Identifying Innate Resistance Hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 Antivirals Using In Silico Protein Techniques.,2023 08 26,"The development and approval of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 has further equipped clinicians with treatment strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing deaths post-infection. Extensive clinical use of antivirals, however, can impart additional selective pressure, leading to the emergence of antiviral resistance. While we have previously characterized possible effects of circulating SARS-CoV-2 missense mutations on proteome function and stability, their direct effects on the novel antivirals remains unexplored. To address this, we have computationally calculated the consequences of mutations in the antiviral targets: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease, on target stability and interactions with their antiviral, nucleic acids, and other proteins. By analyzing circulating variants prior to antiviral approval, this work highlighted the inherent resistance potential of different genome regions. Namely, within the main protease binding site, missense mutations imparted a lower fitness cost, while the opposite was noted for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase binding site. This suggests that resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir combination treatment is more likely to occur and proliferate than that to molnupiravir. These insights are crucial both clinically in drug stewardship, and preclinically in the identification of less mutable targets for novel therapeutic design.",Portelli S; Heaton R; Ascher DB,,,/10.3390/genes14091699,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.3390%2fgenes14091699,0,0,,269
259,Sierra SARS-CoV-2 sequence and antiviral resistance analysis program.,2022 12,"INTRODUCTION: Although most laboratories are capable of employing established protocols to perform full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, many are unable to assess sequence quality, select appropriate mutation-detection thresholds, or report on the potential clinical significance of mutations in the targets of antiviral therapy METHODS: We describe the technical aspects and benchmark the performance of Sierra SARS-CoV-2, a program designed to perform these functions on user-submitted FASTQ and FASTA sequence files and lists of Spike mutations. Sierra SARS-CoV-2 indicates which sequences contain an unexpectedly large number of unusual mutations and which mutations are associated with reduced susceptibility to clinical stage mAbs, the RdRP inhibitor remdesivir, or the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir RESULTS: To assess the performance of Sierra SARS-CoV-2 on FASTQ files, we applied it to 600 representative FASTQ sequences and compared the results to the COVID-19 EDGE program. To assess its performance on FASTA files, we applied it to nearly one million representative FASTA sequences and compared the results to the GISAID mutation annotation. To assess its performance on mutations lists, we applied it to 13,578 distinct Spike RBD mutation patterns and showed that exactly or partially matching annotations were available for 88% of patterns CONCLUSION: Sierra SARS-CoV-2 leverages previously published data to improve the quality control of submitted viral genomic data and to provide functional annotation on the impact of mutations in the targets of antiviral SARS-CoV-2 therapy.

14,Transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to clinical protease inhibitors,,"Vaccines and drugs have helped reduce disease severity and blunt the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing virus transmission, continuous evolution, and increasing selective pressures have the potential to yield viral variants capable of resisting these interventions. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of natural variants of the main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 to protease inhibitors. Multiple single amino acid changes in Mpro confer resistance to nirmatrelvir (the active component of Paxlovid). An additional clinical-stage inhibitor, ensitrelvir (Xocova), shows a different resistance mutation profile. Importantly, phylogenetic analyses indicate that several of these resistant variants have pre-existed the introduction of these drugs into the human population and are capable of spreading. These results encourage the monitoring of resistance variants and the development of additional protease inhibitors and other antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action and resistance profiles for combinatorial therapy.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

224,Assessing Genomic Mutations in SARS-CoV-2: Potential Resistance to Antiviral Drugs in Viral Populations from Untreated COVID-19 Patients.,2023 Dec 19,"Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants mutated in genomic regions targeted by antiviral drugs have not been extensively studied. This study investigated the potential of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex subunits and non-structural protein (Nsp)5 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to accumulate natural mutations that could affect the efficacy of antiviral drugs. To this aim, SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences isolated from 4155 drug-naive individuals from southern Italy were analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing of the 4155 samples showed the following viral variant distribution: 71.2% Delta, 22.2% Omicron, and 6.4% Alpha. In the Nsp12 sequences, we found 84 amino acid substitutions. The most common one was P323L, detected in 3777/4155 (91%) samples, with 2906/3777 (69.9%) also showing the G671S substitution in combination. Additionally, we identified 28, 14, and 24 different amino acid substitutions in the Nsp5, Nsp7, and Nsp8 genomic regions, respectively. Of note, the V186F and A191V substitutions, affecting residues adjacent to the active site of Nsp5 (the target of the antiviral drug Paxlovid), were found in 157/4155 (3.8%) and 3/4155 (0.07%) samples, respectively. In conclusion, the RdRp complex subunits and the Nsp5 genomic region exhibit susceptibility to accumulating natural mutations.

137,Molecular Analyses of Clinical Isolates and Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Carrying B.1 and B.1.617.2 Spike Mutations Suggest a Potential Role of Non-Spike Mutations in Infection Kinetics,,"Some of the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants are less susceptible to neutralization with post-vaccine sera and monoclonal antibodies targeting the viral spike glycoprotein. This raises concerns of disease control, transmissibility, and severity. Numerous substitutions have been identified to increase viral fitness within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins, in addition to spike mutations. Therefore, we sought to generate infectious viruses carrying only the variant-specific spike mutations in an identical backbone to evaluate the impact of spike and non-spike mutations in the virus life cycle. We used en passant mutagenesis to generate recombinant viruses carrying spike mutations of B.1 and B.1.617.2 variants using SARS-CoV-2- bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Neutralization assays using clinical sera yielded comparable results between recombinant viruses and corresponding clinical isolates. Non-spike mutations for both variants neither seemed to effect neutralization efficiencies with monoclonal antibodies nor the response to treatment with inhibitors. However, live-cell imaging and microscopy revealed differences, such as persisting syncytia and pronounced cytopathic effect formation, as well as their progression between BAC-derived viruses and clinical isolates in human lung epithelial cell lines and primary bronchial epithelial cells. Complementary RNA analyses further suggested a potential role of non-spike mutations in infection kinetics.Copyright Â© 2022 by the authors.",Veleanu A.; Kelch M.A.; Ye C.; Flohr M.; Wilhelm A.; Widera M.; Martinez-Sobrido L.; Ciesek S.; Toptan T.,,1999-4915 (electronic),/10.3390/v14092017,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3390%2fv14092017,0,0,,276

Here a panel of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) variants and a robust cell-based assay are used to compare the resistance profiles of nirmatrelvir, ensitrelvir, and FB2001.

9,Evaluation of antiviral drugs against newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants,,"The ongoing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and their rapid worldwide spread pose a threat to public health. From November 2022 to February 2023, newly emerged Omicron subvariants, including BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.5.2, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, and BN.1.9, became prevalent global strains (>5% global prevalence). These Omicron subvariants are resistant to several therapeutic antibodies. Thus, the antiviral activities of current drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, which target highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, against newly emerged Omicron subvariants need to be evaluated. We assessed the antiviral efficacy of the drugs using half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against human isolated 23 Omicron subvariants and four former SARSCoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) and compared them with the antiviral efficacy of these drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (hCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). Maximal IC50 fold changes of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir were 1.9- (BA.2.75.2), 1.2-(B.1.627.2), and 1.4-fold (BA.2.3), respectively, compared to median IC50 values of the reference strain. Moreover, median IC50-fold changes of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir against the Omicron variants were 0.96, 0.4, and 0.62, similar to 1.02, 0.88, and 0.67, respectively, of median IC50-fold changes for previous VOC. Although K90R and P132H in Nsp 5, and P323L, A529V, G671S, V405F, and ins823D in Nsp 12 mutations were identified, these amino acid substitutions did not affect drug antiviral activity. Altogether, these results indicated that the current antivirals retain antiviral efficacy against newly emerged Omicron subvariants, and provide comprehensive information on the antiviral efficacy of these drugs.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
