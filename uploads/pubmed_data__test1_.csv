AI models predicting breast cancer distant metastasis using LightGBM with clinical blood markers and ultrasound maximum diameter.,Jul 2024,"Breast cancer metastasis significantly impacts women's health globally. This study aimed to construct predictive models using clinical blood markers and ultrasound data to predict distant metastasis in breast cancer patients, ensuring clinical applicability, cost-effectiveness, relative non-invasiveness, and accessibility of these models. Analysis was conducted on data from 416 patients across two centers, focusing on clinical blood markers (tumor markers, liver and kidney function indicators, blood lipid markers, cardiovascular biomarkers) and maximum lesion diameter from ultrasound. Feature reduction was performed using Spearman correlation and LASSO regression. Two models were built using LightGBM: a clinical model (using clinical blood markers) and a combined model (incorporating clinical blood markers and ultrasound features), validated in training, internal test, and external validation (test1) cohorts. Feature importance analysis was conducted for both models, followed by univariate and multivariate regression analyses of these features. The AUC values of the clinical model in the training, internal test, and external validation (test1) cohorts were 0.950, 0.795, and 0.883, respectively. The combined model showed AUC values of 0.955, 0.835, and 0.918 in the training, internal test, and external validation (test1) cohorts, respectively. Clinical utility curve analysis indicated the combined model's superior net benefit in identifying breast cancer with distant metastasis across all cohorts. This suggests the combined model's superior discriminatory ability and strong generalization performance. Creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), CEA, CA153, albumin, creatine kinase, and maximum lesion diameter from ultrasound played significant roles in model prediction. CA153, CK-MB, lipoprotein (a), and maximum lesion diameter from ultrasound positively correlated with breast cancer distant metastasis, while indirect bilirubin and magnesium ions showed negative correlations. This study successfully utilized clinical blood markers and ultrasound data to develop AI models for predicting distant metastasis in breast cancer. The combined model, incorporating clinical blood markers and ultrasound features, exhibited higher accuracy, suggesting its potential clinical utility in predicting and identifying breast cancer distant metastasis. These findings highlight the potential prospects of developing cost-effective and accessible predictive tools in clinical oncology.","Tan, Yang; Zhang, Wen-Hai; Huang, Zhen; Tan, Qi-Xing; Zhang, Yue-Mei; Wei, Chang-Yuan; Feng, Zhen-Bo",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-024-66658-x,38969798,"Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, No.6 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, 530000, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.; Department of Breast Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Tumor Hospital, 71 Hedi Road, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.; Department of Breast Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Tumor Hospital, 71 Hedi Road, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.; Department of Breast Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Tumor Hospital, 71 Hedi Road, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.; Department of Breast Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Tumor Hospital, 71 Hedi Road, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.; Department of Breast Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Tumor Hospital, 71 Hedi Road, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. changyuanwei@gxmu.edu.com.; Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, No.6 Shuangyong Road, Nanning, 530000, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.

MoRF_ESM: Prediction of MoRFs in disordered proteins based on a deep transformer protein language model.,Apr 2024,"Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are particular functional segments of disordered proteins, which play crucial roles in regulating the phase transition of membrane-less organelles and frequently serve as central sites in cellular interaction networks. As the association between disordered proteins and severe diseases continues to be discovered, identifying MoRFs has gained growing significance. Due to the limited number of experimentally validated MoRFs, the performance of existing MoRF's prediction algorithms is not good enough and still needs to be improved. In this research, we present a model named MoRF_ESM, which utilizes deep-learning protein representations to predict MoRFs in disordered proteins. This approach employs a pretrained ESM-2 protein language model to generate embedding representations of residues in the form of attention map matrices. These representations are combined with a self-learned TextCNN model for feature extraction and prediction. In addition, an averaging step was incorporated at the end of the MoRF_ESM model to refine the output and generate final prediction results. In comparison to other impressive methods on benchmark datasets, the MoRF_ESM approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving [Formula: see text] higher AUC than other methods when tested on TEST1 and achieving [Formula: see text] higher AUC than other methods when tested on TEST2. These results imply that the combination of ESM-2 and TextCNN can effectively extract deep evolutionary features related to protein structure and function, along with capturing shallow pattern features located in protein sequences, and is well qualified for the prediction task of MoRFs. Given that ESM-2 is a highly versatile protein language model, the methodology proposed in this study can be readily applied to other tasks involving the classification of protein sequences.","Fang, Chun; He, Jiasheng; Yamana, Hayato",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,1757-6334,10.1142/S0219720024500069,38812466,"Department of Information Engineering, Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology, 19 Qingyuan North Road, Daxing District, Beijing 102617, P. R. China.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Okubo, Shinjuku, Tokyo 169-8555, Japan.; Department of Information Engineering, Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology, 19 Qingyuan North Road, Daxing District, Beijing 102617, P. R. China.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Okubo, Shinjuku, Tokyo 169-8555, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38812466,

Development of A New Scoring System in Higher Animals for Testing Cognitive Function in the Newborn Period: Effect of Prenatal Hypoxia-Ischemia.,Mar 2024,"Introduction Enhanced models for assessing cognitive function in the neonatal period are imperative in higher animals. Postnatal motor deficits, characteristic of cerebral palsy, emerge in newborn kits within our prenatal-rabbit model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI). In humans, prenatal HI leads to intellectual disability and cerebral palsy. In a study examining cognitive function in newborn rabbits, we explored several questions. Is there a distinction between conditioned and unconditioned kits? Can the kits discern the human face or the lab coat? Do motorically-normal kits, born after prenatal HI, exhibit cognitive deficits? Methods The conditioning protocol was randomly assigned to kits from each litter. For conditioning, the same human, wearing a lab coat, fed the rabbit kits for 9 days before the cognitive test. The 6-arm radial maze was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use. Normally appearing kits, born after uterine ischemia at 79% or 92% term in New Zealand White rabbits, were compared to Naïve kits. On postpartum day 22/23 or 29/30, the 6-arm maze helped determine if the kits recognized the original feeder from bystander (Test-1) or the lab coat on bystander (Test-2). The use of masks of feeder/bystander (Test-3) assessed confounding cues. A weighted score was devised to address variability in entry to maze arms, time, and repeated-trial learning. Results In conditioned kits, both Naïve and HI kits exhibited a significant preference for the face of the feeder, but not the lab coat. Cognitive deficits were minimal in normal-appearing HI kits. Conclusion The weighted score system was amenable to statistical manipulation.","Shi, Zhongjie; Sharif, Nadiya; Luo, Kehuan; Tan, Sidhartha",Developmental neuroscience,1421-9859,10.1159/000538607,38547848,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38547848,

Nocebo effects in visceral pain: concept and design of the experimental randomized-controlled pain study 'NoVis'.,2023,"The role of psychological factors in the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic visceral pain in disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) is increasingly appreciated. Placebo research has underscored that expectations arising from the psychosocial treatment context and from prior experiences shape treatment responses. However, effects of negative expectations, i.e., nocebo effects, as they are likely crucial elements of DGBI patients' clinical reality, have thus far only rarely been investigated in the context of visceral pain, with untapped potential for improved prevention and treatment. The experimental randomized-controlled pain study ""NoVis,"" carried out within the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 289 (""Treatment Expectation""), aims to close gaps regarding the generation and persistence of nocebo effects in healthy volunteers. It is designed to elucidate effects of negative expectations in a multiple-threat paradigm with intensity-matched rectal distensions and cutaneous thermal stimuli, allowing to test nocebo effects in the visceral and somatic pain modalities. Negative expectations are experimentally induced by elements of doctor-patient communication (i.e., instruction) and/or by surreptitious amplification of symptom intensity (i.e., experience/learning) within a treatment context. Accordingly, the repeated measures between-subject design contains the between-group factors ""treatment instruction"" (negative vs. control) and ""treatment experience"" (negative vs. control), with volunteers randomized into four experimental groups undergoing several pain stimulation phases (repeated factor). This allows to compare the efficacy of instruction vs. experience, and more importantly, their combined effects on the magnitude of negative expectations and their impact on pain responses, which we expect will be greatest for the visceral modality.

CHSNet: Automatic lesion segmentation network guided by CT image features for acute cerebral hemorrhage.,Sep 2023,"Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease that can lead to severe sequelae such as hemiplegia and mental retardation with a mortality rate of up to 40%. In this paper, we proposed an automatic segmentation network (CHSNet) to segment the lesions in cranial CT images based on the characteristics of acute cerebral hemorrhage images, such as high density, multi-scale, and variable location, and realized the three-dimensional (3D) visualization and localization of the cranial lesions after the segmentation was completed. To enhance the feature representation of high-density regions, and capture multi-scale and up-down information on the target location, we constructed a convolutional neural network with encoding-decoding backbone, Res-RCL module, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, and Attention Gate. We collected images of 203 patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage, constructed a dataset containing 5998 cranial CT slices, and conducted comparative and ablation experiments on the dataset to verify the effectiveness of our model. Our model achieved the best results on both test sets with different segmentation difficulties, test1: Dice = 0.918, IoU = 0.853, ASD = 0.476, RVE = 0.113; test2: Dice = 0.716, IoU = 0.604, ASD = 5.402, RVE = 1.079.

Pelvic + Anatomy: A new interactive pelvic anatomy model. Prospective randomized control trial with first-year midwife residents.,2023,"Detailed knowledge of female pelvic floor anatomy is essential for midwifery and other professionals in obstetrics. Physical models have shown great potential for teaching anatomy and enhancing surgical skills. In this article, we introduce an innovative physical anatomy model called ""Pelvic+"" to teach anatomical relationships in the female pelvis. The Pelvic+ model's value was compared to a traditional lecture in 61 first-year midwifery students randomly allocated to either the Pelvic+ (n = 30) or a control group (n = 32). The primary outcome measure was a quiz comprised of 15 multiple choice questions on pelvic anatomy. Participants were assessed at baseline (Pre-Test), upon completion of the intervention (Post-Test1) and 4 months afterward (Post-Test2). Satisfaction with the approach was assessed at Post-Test1. Increase in knowledge was greater and the approach more accepted among resident midwives when Pelvic+ was used instead of standard lectures. Four months after the intervention, the improvement in knowledge was preserved in the Pelvic+ group. This randomized study demonstrates that the Pelvic+ simulator is more effective than classical learning for pelvic anatomy education, and offers a higher level of satisfaction among students during the educational process. Medical students training in obstetrics and gynecology, or any professional who specializes in the female pelvic floor might also benefit from incorporation of the Pelvic+ model into their training program.","Pereda-Nuñez, Ana; Manresa, Margarita; Webb, Sara S; Pineda, Benjamín; Espuña, Montserrat; Ortega, Marisa; Rodríguez-Baeza, Alfonso",Anatomical sciences education,1935-9780,10.1002/ase.2304,37312278,"Gynaecology and Obstetrics Service, Hospital General of Granollers, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Royal College of Midwives, London, UK.; Freelance, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Institut Medicina Legal i Ciències Forenses de Catalunya (IMLCFC), Department of Morphological Sciences of School of Medicine, UAB, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Morphological Sciences of School of Medicine, UAB, Barcelona, Spain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37312278,
Use of machine learning-based integration to develop an immune-related signature for improving prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.,Apr 2023,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Although some patients benefit from immunotherapy, the majority of patients have unsatisfactory immunotherapy outcomes, and the clinical significance of immune-related genes in gastric cancer remains unknown. We used the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method to evaluate the immune cell content of gastric cancer patients from TCGA and clustered patients based on immune cell scores. The Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm was used to identify immune subtype-related genes. The patients in TCGA were randomly divided into test 1 and test 2 in a 1:1 ratio, and a machine learning integration process was used to determine the best prognostic signatures in the total cohort. The signatures were then validated in the test 1 and the test 2 cohort. Based on a literature search, we selected 93 previously published prognostic signatures for gastric cancer and compared them with our prognostic signatures. At the single-cell level, the algorithms ""Seurat,"" ""SCEVAN"", ""scissor"", and ""Cellchat"" were used to demonstrate the cell communication disturbance of high-risk cells. WGCNA and univariate Cox regression analysis identified 52 prognosis-related genes, which were subjected to 98 machine-learning integration processes. A prognostic signature consisting of 24 genes was identified using the StepCox[backward] and Enet[alpha = 0.7] machine learning algorithms. This signature demonstrated the best prognostic performance in the overall, test1 and test2 cohort, and outperformed 93 previously published prognostic signatures. Interaction perturbations in cellular communication of high-risk T cells were identified at the single-cell level, which may promote disease progression in patients with gastric cancer. We developed an immune-related prognostic signature with reliable validity and high accuracy for clinical use for predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.","Ning, Jingyuan; Sun, Keran; Fan, Xiaoqing; Jia, Keqi; Meng, Lingtong; Wang, Xiuli; Li, Hui; Ma, Ruixiao; Liu, Subin; Li, Feng; Wang, Xiaofeng",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-023-34291-9,37120631,"Department of Immunology, Immunology Department of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Immunology, Immunology Department of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Immunology, Immunology Department of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Pathology, Shijiazhuang People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Immunology, Immunology Department of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Laboratory, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Oncology, Shijiazhuang Fourth Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Oncology, Shijiazhuang Fourth Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Oncology, Shijiazhuang Fourth Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Oncology, Shijiazhuang Fourth Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Immunology, Immunology Department of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China. wxf9992021@163.com.; Department of Oncology, Shijiazhuang Fourth Hospital, Shijiazhuang, People's Republic of China. wxf9992021@163.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120631,
Ocular surface immune cell diversity in dry eye disease.,Apr 2023,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial chronic ocular surface inflammatory condition. Disease severity has been directly related to the immuno-inflammatory status of the ocular surface. Any perturbation in the orchestrated functional harmony between the ocular surface structural cells and immune cells, both resident and trafficking ones, can adversely affect ocular surface health. The diversity and contribution of ocular surface immune cells in DED have been of interest for over a couple of decades. As is true with any mucosal tissue, the ocular surface harbors a variety of immune cells of the innate-adaptive continuum and some of which are altered in DED. The current review curates and organizes the knowledge related to the ocular surface immune cell diversity in DED. Ten different major immune cell types and 21 immune cell subsets have been studied in the context of DED in human subjects and in animal models. The most pertinent observations are increased ocular surface proportions of neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cell subsets (CD4+; CD8+; Th17) along with a decrease in T regulatory cells. Some of these cells have demonstrated disease-causal association with ocular surface health parameters such as OSDI score, Schirmer's test-1, tear break-up time, and corneal staining. The review also summarizes various interventional strategies studied to modulate specific immune cell subsets and reduce DED severity. Further advancements would enable the use of ocular surface immune cell diversity, in patient stratification, i.e. DED-immunotypes, disease monitoring, and selective targeting to resolve the morbidity related to DED.","Nair, Archana Padmanabhan; D'Souza, Sharon; Khamar, Pooja; Nuijts, Rudy M M A; Sethu, Swaminathan; Shetty, Rohit",Indian journal of ophthalmology,1998-3689,10.4103/IJO.IJO_2986_22,37026254,"GROW Research Laboratory, Narayana Nethralaya Foundation, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India.; Department of Cornea and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.; Department of Cornea and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.; Department of Ophthalmology, University Eye Clinic Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; GROW Research Laboratory, Narayana Nethralaya Foundation, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.; Department of Cornea and Refractive Surgery, Narayana Nethralaya, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37026254,

Changes in tear production in a dog with keratoconjunctivitis sicca for a year after inevitable nictitating membrane gland resection due to suspicion of a malignant tumour.,Nov 2022,"Since the removal of the NM causes KCS in dogs, it was contraindicated to remove the NM unless unavoidable such as in a malignant tumour. However, to the best of author's knowledge, there are no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis owing to decreased tear production following removal of the NM gland. This case study demonstrates the tear production changes in a dog for a year after removal of the nictitating membrane (NM) due to suspicion of a malignant tumour. A 13-year-old spayed female English Cocker Spaniel who had suffered from severe ocular discharge, discomfort, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), and NM enlargement in the right eye was brought to our hospital. The dog could not tolerate treatment with topical 0.2% cyclosporine or corticosteroids. The dog's right eye had NM gland prolapse, severe follicular conjunctivitis and a very low Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) value of 3 mm/min. Furthermore, the result of fine needle aspiration of the enlarged NM gland suggested a risk of malignancy. Despite the risk of KCS, complete NM resection was performed to diagnose the tumour. Fortunately, the final histopathological evaluation revealed chronic inflammation without any evidence of malignancy. Contrary to concerns that the STT-1 value would further decrease after the removal of the NM gland, the STT-1 value remained elevated compared to that before surgery, and the clinical symptoms improved for a year. It is generally known that NM gland resection is not recommended due to the risk of developing iatrogenic KCS unless a malignant tumour is suspected. In this case, surgical removal of the inflammatory NM gland that was not responsive to medications had a positive effect on KCS. Since the inflammatory and structural disease of the NM was strengthening KCS, the outcome was thought to be different from that when the normal third eyelid was removed.","Yoon, Hyun-Jeong; Kim, Joon-Young",Veterinary medicine and science,2053-1095,10.1002/vms3.919,36049128,"Department of Veterinary Ophthalmology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Veterinary Ophthalmology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.; KU Center for Animal Blood Medical Science, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36049128,

Reducing Calibration Time in PET Systems Based on Monolithic Crystals.,2021,"In the past years, the gamma-ray detector designs based on the monolithic crystals have demonstrated to be excellent candidates for the design of high-performance PET systems. The monolithic crystals allow to achieve the intrinsic detector resolutions well below state-of-the-art; to increase packing fraction thus, increasing the system sensitivity; and to improve lesion detectability at the edges of the scanner field of view (FOV) because of their intrinsic depth of interaction (DOI) capabilities. The bottleneck to translate to the clinical PET systems based on a large number of monolithic detectors is eventually the requirement of mechanically complex and time-consuming calibration processes. To mitigate this drawback, several methods have been already proposed, such as using non-physically collimated radioactive sources or implementing the neuronal networks (NN) algorithms trained with simulated data. In this work, we aimed to simplify and fasten a calibration process of the monolithic based systems.

Cephalogram synthesis and landmark detection in dental cone-beam CT systems.,May 2021,"Due to the lack of a standardized 3D cephalometric analysis methodology, 2D cephalograms synthesized from 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes are widely used for cephalometric analysis in dental CBCT systems. However, compared with conventional X-ray film based cephalograms, such synthetic cephalograms lack image contrast and resolution, which impairs cephalometric landmark identification. In addition, the increased radiation dose applied to acquire the scan for 3D reconstruction causes potential health risks. In this work, we propose a sigmoid-based intensity transform that uses the nonlinear optical property of X-ray films to increase image contrast of synthetic cephalograms from 3D volumes. To improve image resolution, super resolution deep learning techniques are investigated. For low dose purpose, the pixel-to-pixel generative adversarial network (pix2pixGAN) is proposed for 2D cephalogram synthesis directly from two cone-beam projections. For landmark detection in the synthetic cephalograms, an efficient automatic landmark detection method using the combination of LeNet-5 and ResNet50 is proposed. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of pix2pixGAN in 2D cephalogram synthesis, achieving an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of 33.8 with reference to the cephalograms synthesized from 3D CBCT volumes. Pix2pixGAN also achieves the best performance in super resolution, achieving an average PSNR value of 32.5 without the introduction of checkerboard or jagging artifacts. Our proposed automatic landmark detection method achieves 86.7% successful detection rate in the 2 mm clinical acceptable range on the ISBI Test1 data, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

Schirmer Tear Test Value and Corneal Lesions' Incidence during General Anesthesia for Non-Ophthalmic Surgery in Non-Brachycephalic Dogs: A Pilot Study Comparing Three Different Lubricant Eye Drop Formulations.,Feb 2020,"Aim of this blinded, prospective, randomized clinical study was to compare three different lubricant eye drops (LED) in healthy adult dogs undergoing general anaesthesia (GA) for non-ophthalmic surgery. Tear production rate was monitored by means of Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1), and incidence of post-operative corneal abrasions/ulcerations was detected by corneal staining. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed before premedication, at extubation time and 24 h after GA in twenty-five non-brachycephalic dogs (fifty eyes) undergoing elective orthopaedic or spinal surgery procedures. Dogs were randomly allocated to one of three groups receiving as prophylactic LED either carmellose sodium (GC), or 1% hyaluronic acid (GH), or 0.25% hyaluronic acid (GL). In each eye STT-1 was repeated every hour during GA, before instilling one drop of the assigned LED. In all groups STT-1 values drastically decreased during GA, while 24 h later nine eyes (18%) had STT-1 values lower than 15 mm/minute. All of the three formulations tested were fully effective in preventing corneal ulceration (0% in all groups), while 10% of eyes reported superficial de-epithelialization. Fluorescein staining demonstrated that hourly prophylactic LED application prevented exposure keratopathy during general anesthesia in 90% of the eyes in non-brachycephalic dogs.","Di Palma, Cristina; Micieli, Fabiana; Lamagna, Barbara; Nieddu, Annalisa; Uccello, Valeria; Fatone, Gerardo; Vesce, Giancarlo",Veterinary sciences,2306-7381,10.3390/vetsci7010025,32085462,"Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.; Medical Manager (Veterinary Division Aurora Biofarma), 20131 Milano, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Production, University of Napoli Federico II, 80137 Napoli, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32085462,
Nerve growth factor in dogs: Assessment of two immunoassays and selected ocular parameters following a nicergoline challenge per os.,Jan 2020,"Impairment of corneal nerves can result in the development of ocular surface diseases such as aqueous tear deficiency and neurotrophic keratopathy. This study investigates oral nicergoline, an α-adrenoceptor antagonist shown to enhance endogenous secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by the lacrimal gland, as a potential therapy for these conditions. Five female spayed Beagle dogs received a 2-week course of oral nicergoline (10 mg twice daily). Drug safety was evaluated with ophthalmic and physical examinations, blood pressure monitoring, bloodwork, and urinalysis. The effect of nicergoline on the ocular surface was assessed with corneal esthesiometry, Schirmer tear test-1, and tear film breakup time. Drug effect on NGF levels was assessed by collecting tears and blood at baseline and completion of therapy using a bead-based immunoassay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although nicergoline was well tolerated in all dogs, it did not have a significant impact on corneal sensitivity, tear production, or tear stability. Of note, NGF was below the limit of quantification in all tear samples and was only detected in 8/20 serum samples with no significant difference between levels at baseline (189.4 ± 145.1 pg/mL) and completion of therapy (149.4 ± 79.4 pg/mL).

Automated measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate: method validation and comparison.,Aug 2019,"Background Development of automated analyzers for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has imposed the need for extensive validation prior to their implementation in routine practice, to ensure comparability with the reference Westergren method. The aim of our study was to perform the analytical validation of two automated ESR analyzers, the Ves-Matic Cube 200 and the TEST1. Methods Validation was performed according to the recent International Council for Standardization in Hematology recommendations and included determination of intrarun and inter-run precision, assessment of sample carryover, hemolysis interference, sensitivity to fibrinogen, method comparison with the gold standard Westergren method and stability test. Results The highest intrarun imprecision was obtained for the low ESR range (33.5% for Ves-Matic Cube; 37.3% for TEST1) while inter-run coefficients of variation on three levels were much better for the TEST1 (0%, 2% and 1.2%) compared to the Ves-Matic Cube 200 on two levels (24.9% and 5.8%). Both Ves-Matic Cube 200 and TEST1 showed no statistically significant difference when compared with Westergren. Bland-Altman analysis yielded overall insignificant mean biases for all comparisons, but a wider dispersion of results and 95% limits of agreement for comparisons including the Ves-Matic Cube 200. Carryover was considered insignificant, while hemolysis had a negative effect on all assessed ESR methods. The highest sensitivity to fibrinogen was observed for the Ves-Matic Cube 200, followed by Westergren and the least sensitive was the TEST1. Conclusions The obtained results proved the analytical validity of the TEST1 and the Ves-Matic Cube 200, and high comparability with the gold standard Westergren method, showing obvious improvements in standardization of ESR methods.","Lapić, Ivana; Piva, Elisa; Spolaore, Federica; Tosato, Francesca; Pelloso, Michela; Plebani, Mario",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,1437-4331,10.1515/cclm-2019-0204,30939112,"Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Kišpatićeva 12, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, Phone: +385 98 1767367.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30939112,

Results of corneal aesthesiometry, Schirmer tear test-1 (STT-1) and tear film breakup time revealed corneal hypoesthesia, and quantitative and qualitative tear film deficiency OU. Noxious olfactory stimulation caused increased lacrimation relative to standard STT-1 values suggesting an intact nasolacrimal reflex.

Pilocarpine, especially when given orally, was associated with notable increases in STT-1 values, but corneal ulceration remained/recurred regardless of administration route, and oral pilocarpine resulted in gastrointestinal upset. Tacrolimus was not effective. After 93 days, the cat became weak and lame and a low thyroxine concentration was detected in serum. The cat was euthanized and a necropsy performed.

Transcription and regulation of hepatitis B virus genes in host sperm cells.,2018,"To investigate whether transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene occurs in human sperm, total RNA was extracted from sperm of patients with chronic HBV infection (test-1), from donor sperm transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome (test-2), and from nontransfected donor sperm (control), used as the template for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive bands for HBV DNA were observed in the test groups but not in the control. Next, to identify the role of host genes in regulating viral gene transcription in sperm, total RNA was extracted from 2-cell embryos derived from hamster oocytes fertilized in vitro by HBV-transfected (test) or nontransfected (control) human sperm and successively subjected to SMART-PCR, suppression subtractive hybridization, T/A cloning, bacterial amplification, microarray hybridization, sequencing and the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search to isolate differentially expressed genes. Twenty-nine sequences showing significant identity to five human gene families were identified, with chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 2 (CSH2), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (EIF4G2), pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 2 (PCBD2), pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 4 (PSG4) and titin (TTN) selected to represent target genes.

The impact of diurnal sleep on the consolidation of a complex gross motor adaptation task.,Feb 2015,"Diurnal sleep effects on consolidation of a complex, ecological valid gross motor adaptation task were examined using a bicycle with an inverse steering device. We tested 24 male subjects aged between 20 and 29 years using a between-subjects design. Participants were trained to adapt to the inverse steering bicycle during 45 min. Performance was tested before (TEST1) and after (TEST2) training, as well as after a 2 h retention interval (TEST3). During retention, participants either slept or remained awake. To assess gross motor performance, subjects had to ride the inverse steering bicycle 3 × 30 m straight-line and 3 × 30 m through a slalom. Beyond riding time, we sophisticatedly measured performance accuracy (standard deviation of steering angle) in both conditions using a rotatory potentiometer. A significant decrease of accuracy during straight-line riding after nap and wakefulness was shown. Accuracy during slalom riding remained stable after wakefulness but was reduced after sleep. We found that the duration of rapid eye movement sleep as well as sleep spindle activity are negatively related with gross motor performance changes over sleep. Together these findings suggest that the consolidation of adaptation to a new steering device does not benefit from a 2 h midday nap. We speculate that in case of strongly overlearned motor patterns such as normal cycling, diurnal sleep spindles and rapid eye movement sleep might even help to protect everyday needed skills, and to rapidly forget newly acquired, interfering and irrelevant material.","Hoedlmoser, Kerstin; Birklbauer, Juergen; Schabus, Manuel; Eibenberger, Patrick; Rigler, Sandra; Mueller, Erich",Journal of sleep research,1365-2869,10.1111/jsr.12207,25256866,"Laboratory for Sleep, Cognition and Consciousness Research, Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256866,
Whole-blood gene-expression profiles of cows infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis reveal changes in immune response and lipid metabolism.,Feb 2015,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease, a chronic debilitating disease affecting ruminants worldwide. In the present study, we aimed to determine the major gene networks and pathways underlying the immune response to MAP infection using whole-blood cells, as well as provide the potential transcriptional markers for identifying the status of MAP infection. We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of whole-blood cells of cattle identified and grouped according to the presence of MAP-specific antibodies and the MAP shed by them. The grouping was based on the results obtained by ELISA and PCR analyses as follows: i) Test1 group: MAP-negative results obtained by ELISA and positive results obtained by PCR; ii) Test2 group: MAP-positive results obtained by ELISA and negative results obtained by PCR; iii) Test3 group: MAP-positive results obtained by ELISA and positive results obtained by PCR; iv) uninfected control: MAP-negative results obtained both by ELISA and PCR analysis. The results showed down-regulated production and metabolism of reactive oxygen species in the Test1 group, activation of pathways related to the host-defense response against MAP (LXR/RXR activation and complement system) in the Test2 and Test3 groups, and anti-inflammatory response (activation of IL-10 signaling pathway) only in the Test3 group.

Can children with autism read emotions from the eyes? The eyes test revisited.,May 2014,"This study aimed to test two new, simplified tasks related to the eye-test, targeting children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls (TD). Test-1 assessed the recognition of emotion/mental states with displays using one word and two eye-pictures, whereas Test-2 presented displays using two words and one eye-picture. Black and white photographs of children were used as materials. A cross-cultural study (Caucasian/East-Asian) with adults was initially carried out to verify generalizability across different ethnic groups. Cross-sectional trajectory analyses were used to compare emotion recognition from the eyes in the two tests. Trajectories were constructed linking performance on both tests either to chronological age or to different measures of mental age (receptive vocabulary based on the BPVS, CARS or ASQ for the ASD group). Performance improved with chronological age in both the ASD and TD groups of children. However, performance in Test-1 was significantly superior in children with ASD, who showed delayed onset and slower rate of improvement than TD children in Test-2. In both the ASD and TD groups the lowest error rate was recorded for the item 'anger', suggesting that threat-detection cue mechanisms may be intact in autism. In general, all children showed good performance on our novel tests, thus making them good candidates for assessing younger children and those with lower general abilities.","Franco, Fabia; Itakura, Shoji; Pomorska, Krystyna; Abramowski, Anna; Nikaido, Kozue; Dimitriou, Dagmara",Research in developmental disabilities,1873-3379,10.1016/j.ridd.2014.01.037,24636022,"Department of Psychology, School of Health and Education, Middlesex University, London, UK.

"Long-term expression of human contextual fear and extinction memories involves amygdala, hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex: a reinstatement study in two independent samples.",Dec 2014,"Human context conditioning studies have focused on acquisition and extinction. Subsequent long-term changes in fear behaviors not only depend on associative learning processes during those phases but also on memory consolidation processes and the later ability to retrieve and express fear and extinction memories. Clinical theories explain relapse after successful exposure-based treatment with return of fear memories and remission with stable extinction memory expression. We probed contextual fear and extinction memories 1 week (Day8) after conditioning (Day1) and subsequent extinction (Day2) by presenting conditioned contexts before (Test1) and after (Test2) a reinstatement manipulation. We find consistent activation patterns in two independent samples: activation of a subgenual part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex before reinstatement (Test1) and (albeit with different temporal profiles between samples) of the amygdala after reinstatement (Test2) as well as up-regulation of anterior hippocampus activity after reinstatement (Test2 > Test1). These areas have earlier been implicated in the expression of cued extinction and fear memories. The present results suggest a general role for these structures in defining the balance between fear and extinction memories, independent of the conditioning mode.

A comparison of the hazard perception ability of accident-involved and accident-free motorcycle riders.,Jul 2011,"Hazard perception is the ability to read the road and is closely related to involvement in traffic accidents. It consists of both cognitive and behavioral components. Within the cognitive component, visual attention is an important function of driving whereas driving behavior, which represents the behavioral component, can affect the hazard perception of the driver. Motorcycle riders are the most vulnerable types of road user. The primary purpose of this study was to deepen our understanding of the correlation of different subtypes of visual attention and driving violation behaviors and their effect on hazard perception between accident-free and accident-involved motorcycle riders. Sixty-three accident-free and 46 accident-involved motorcycle riders undertook four neuropsychological tests of attention (Digit Vigilance Test, Color Trails Test-1, Color Trails Test-2, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), filled out the Chinese Motorcycle Rider Driving Violation (CMRDV) Questionnaire, and viewed a road-user-based hazard situation with an eye-tracking system to record the response latencies to potentially dangerous traffic situations. The results showed that both the divided and selective attention of accident-involved motorcycle riders were significantly inferior to those of accident-free motorcycle riders, and that accident-involved riders exhibited significantly higher driving violation behaviors and took longer to identify hazardous situations compared to their accident-free counterparts. However, the results of the regression analysis showed that aggressive driving violation CMRDV score significantly predicted hazard perception and accident involvement of motorcycle riders. Given that all participants were mature and experienced motorcycle riders, the most plausible explanation for the differences between them is their driving style (influenced by an undesirable driving attitude), rather than skill deficits per se. The present study points to the importance of conceptualizing the influence of different driving behaviors so as to enrich our understanding of the role of human factors in road accidents and consequently develop effective countermeasures to prevent traffic accidents involving motorcycles.","Cheng, Andy S K; Ng, Terry C K; Lee, Hoe C",Accident; analysis and prevention,1879-2057,10.1016/j.aap.2011.02.024,21545879,"Ergonomics and Human Performance Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. andy.cheng@polyu.edu.hk",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545879,

"Comprehensive evaluation of a single-stage submaximal treadmill walking protocol in healthy, middle-aged women.",Jan 2011,"Cardiorespiratory fitness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in women; however, maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) protocols are not always feasible. The Evaluation of Physical Activity Measures in Middle-Aged Women Study was a 6-week study designed to evaluate six physical activity (PA) measures in women, aged 45-65 years. We investigated the Ebbeling submaximal treadmill (EbbTM) protocol's ability to reflect an active lifestyle in 66 women [median (IQR) age, 51.0 (48.0, 56.5) years]. Participants were screened using ACSM and AHA guidelines and classified as moderate or low cardiovascular risk. VO(2max) was estimated using the EbbTM in all participants (TEST1). Moderate risk women repeated the EbbTM (TEST2) while low risk completed a maximal treadmill test. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC(90)) score were calculated to examine reliability. Spearman rank order or Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to determine the association between estimated VO(2max) and physical fitness and activity measures. Estimated VO(2max) from the EbbTM protocol had excellent reproducibility [ICC = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98) and MDC(90) was 1.62 mL kg(-1) min(-1). The EbbTM protocol was associated with measured VO(2max) (ρ = 0.48; p = 0.01) and was positively correlated with moderate- (ρ = 0.32; p = 0.02), vigorous- (ρ = 0.47; p = 0.0005) and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (ρ = 0.36; p = 0.009), pedometer steps (ρ = 0.41; p = 0.002) and inversely correlated with waist circumference (ρ = -0.58; p < 0.0001), body fat (ρ = -0.55; p < 0.0001), and right leg endurance (ρ = -0.41; p = 0.003).

Single and repeated baclofen treatment attenuates the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine in rats.,Dec 2010,"The GABA(B) agonists block the rewarding properties of opiates. However, the role of GABA(B) receptors in the discriminative properties of these drugs has received little attention. In this line, the present study was performed to investigate the effects of acute (Experiment 1) and chronic (Experiment 2) pretreatment with baclofen on the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine. Rats were trained to discriminate morphine (5mg/kgi.p.) from saline under a two-lever fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement. Experiment 1: a morphine generalization curve was obtained under standard conditions in control and baclofen (1 and 2mg/kgi.p.) pretreated animals. Acute baclofen pretreatment attenuated morphine-lever responding and response rate at both doses. Experiment 2: the animals were randomly divided in two groups and a morphine generalization curve was obtained in daily consecutive test sessions before (TEST1) and after (TEST2) chronic saline (Group I) or chronic baclofen (2mg/kg) (Group II) administration. As expected, chronic saline pretreatment was ineffective, while chronic baclofen pretreatment attenuated the stimulus properties of morphine, without modifying the rate-decreasing effect of the drug.The data support a role for GABAergic neurotransmission in the discriminative effects of opiates and demonstrate that a short-term treatment with baclofen is useful for decreasing the sensitivity to narcotic cue.","Bartoletti, Maria; Colantoni, Alessia; De Luca, Valentina; Gaiardi, Margherita","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",1873-5177,10.1016/j.pbb.2010.08.011,20807548,"Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, I-40126 Bologna, Italy. maria.bartoletti@unibo.it",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20807548,

Effects of maximal oxygen uptake test and prolonged cycle ergometer exercise on the quiet standing control.,Jun 2010,"This work aims at testing the influence of peripheral and central fatigue, after maximal oxygen uptake test (Test1) and prolonged (Test2) cycle ergometer exercises, respectively, on sway density curve (SDC) parameters of postural control. Sixteen healthy male subjects were submitted to stabilometric tests, before and after the exercises. The Test1 was started at 12.5W, with 12.5W/min increments and 50rpm cadence until exhaustion. From the respiratory gas exchange signals, the first ventilatory threshold was obtained by the v-slope method. After a minimum of 72h, the subjects performed the Test2 for 60min, at a power output corresponding to 70% of such threshold. Before and just after these exercises, a set of 10 stabilometric trials of 50s was performed, alternating the eyes open and closed conditions, intercalated by a 10s resting period. The resulting signals were used to obtain the SDC. The Test1 caused decrease of the mean of peaks duration in SDC (p<0.05), decreasing the stability level, with small changes in the rates of central nervous system (CNS) and muscular torque controls. Conversely, Test2 increased the mean of time intervals between peaks in SDC (p<0.05), thus decreasing the CNS commands rate with minor changes in the stability level. Visual privation had a greater effect on body sway than these exercises, which were applied to muscles that are not the main actuators in body sway control. Concluding, this study allowed discriminating the effects of exercise intensities on body sway control.","Mello, Roger Gomes Tavares; de Oliveira, Liliam Fernandes; Nadal, Jurandir",Gait & posture,1879-2219,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2010.04.016,20542431,"Biomedical Engineering Program, COPPE, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, 21941-972 - Rio de Janeiro - RJ, Brazil. roger@peb.ufrj.br",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20542431,

Students in two middle schools were given HIV/AIDS health education. The education in Tiechang town was carried out in the form of delivering multimedia lectures, video tapes and brochures, while in Daping town brochures were distributed to students. After receiving health education, each student extended the health education to three peasants who were their relatives or neighbours. After the education was provided, the test scores of AIDS knowledge increased significantly in the students of Tiechang town (0.50 baseline, 0.69 post-test1, 0.68 post-test2). For the expansion subjects, the scores increased significantly (0.56 baseline versus 0.74 post-test) in the Tiechang group, and also increased mildly (0.52 baseline versus 0.59 post-test) in the Daping group.

Evaluating the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in a pediatric population.,Jul 2009,"Although smell loss has several potential etiologies (e.g., head trauma, allergic rhinitis, and enlarged adenoids) that are common among children, studies evaluating the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the pediatric population are rare. Several challenges confront the clinician or researcher hoping to evaluate odor identification ability in young children. Children are likely to be unfamiliar with many of the odor stimuli used in adult tests and have limited ability to read and identify labels to select from alternative choices, which is the typical adult response option. Consequently, specialized forms of olfactory tests must be developed for this population. Based on the format of the San Diego Odor Identification Test(1) and the delivery system of the Brief Smell Identification Test,(2) we are developing a short form odor identification test utilizing standardized odor stimuli in which participants match 6 odorants to pictures of the odor source. The pilot version of this test is being administered to children between the ages of 3-17 as part of the pre-surgical intake evaluation at the A.I. duPont Hospital for Children and as part of basic research studies at the Monell Center. The hospital study population is broad and includes children undergoing ear, nose, and throat surgery as well as controls subjects (children undergoing general surgery), with approximately 50 children per week eligible for evaluation. To improve correct interpretation of the results, stimulus familiarity is evaluated by having the child's parent/guardian also complete the test and answer a short questionnaire about the child's experience with the various odor stimuli. The challenges confronted in studying this clinical population as well as extrapolation to larger populations will be discussed.","Dalton, Pamela; Mennella, Julie A; Cowart, Beverly J; Maute, Christopher; Pribitkin, Edmund A; Reilly, James S",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1749-6632,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03919.x,19686190,"Monell Chemical Senses Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. pdalton@pobox.upenn.edu",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19686190,
Changes in oxygen consumption of human muscle and tendon following repeat muscle contractions.,Nov 2008,"The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the oxygen consumption (VO(2)) of muscle and tendon following repeat muscle contractions. During endurance tests (50 repetitions at 70% of the maximum voluntary contraction with 5-s contractions and 5-s rest) and the recovery period (0-10 min), we measured the blood volume and oxygen saturation (StO(2)) of the medial gastrocnemius muscle and Achilles tendon using near infrared spectroscopy and red laser light. Nine male subjects performed the endurance tests three times on separate days (tests-1, 2, and 3). Before and after (test-1: immediately after, test-2: at the 5-min recovery point, test-3: at the 10-min recovery point) the endurance tests, the rate of StO(2) during 8-min period of arterial occlusion was measured to estimate the VO(2) of muscle and tendon. In test-3, after the end of exercise, the THb and StO(2) of the Achilles tendon increased gradually, and these values were higher than the pre-exercise levels until the end of the recovery period. The VO(2) of tendon as well as muscle increased significantly after the repeat muscle contractions. Furthermore, the VO(2) of tendon returned to the pre-exercise level at the 10-min point of recovery, although that of muscle was significantly higher compared to the pre-exercise level until the end of the recovery period. These results indicate that the difference between oxygen supply and consumption within tendon was greater after compared to before exercise.","Kubo, Keitaro; Ikebukuro, Toshihiro; Tsunoda, Naoya; Kanehisa, Hiroaki",European journal of applied physiology,1439-6319,10.1007/s00421-008-0841-4,18677505,"Department of Life Science, University of Tokyo, Komaba 3-8-1, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan. kubo@idaten.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18677505,

Formulation optimization of propranolol hydrochloride microcapsules employing central composite design.,2008,"A central composite design was employed to produce microcapsules of propranolol hydrochloride by o/o emulsion solvent evaporation technique using a mixture of cellulose acetate butyrate as coat material and span-80 as an emulsifier. The effect of formulation variables namely levels of cellulose acetate butyrate (X(1)) and percentage of Span-80 (X(2)) on encapsulation efficiency (Y(1)), drug release at the end of 1.5 h (Y(2)), 4 h (Y(3)), 8 h (Y(4)), 14 h (Y(5)), and 24 h (Y(6)) were evaluated using the F test. Mathematical models containing only the significant terms were generated for each response parameter using multiple linear regression analysis and analysis of variance. Both the formulation variables exerted a significant influence (P <0.05) on Y(1) whereas the cellulose acetate butyrate level emerged as the lone factor which significantly influenced the other response parameters. Numerical optimization using desirability approach was employed to develop an optimized formulation by setting constraints on the dependent and independent variables. The experimental values of Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), and Y(6) for the optimized formulation was found to be 92.86+/-1.56% w/w, 29.58+/-1.22%, 48.56+/-2.56%, 60.85+/-2.35%, 76.23+/-3.16% and 95.12+/-2.41%, respectively which were in close agreement with those predicted by the mathematical models.

Testing procedure included dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan; calculation of daily energy intake and expenditure; and venous blood sampling for fasting ghrelin, leptin, and adiponectin. In the competitors' group, a significant (P < .05) 4.1-kg loss of body fat was observed that resulted in 6.5% +/- 1.5% of the body fat at the end of the study. Ghrelin increased significantly by 20.4% by TEST2. By TEST3, ghrelin was further increased by 6% (P > .05). The pattern of leptin was opposite, with a significant 27.7% decrease at TEST2 and no further decrease at TEST3 (P > .05). No significant change was observed in adiponectin concentration during the study. In the control group, no significant changes in biochemical parameters were observed. In conclusion, ghrelin concentration significantly increases, but is suppressed in conditions of limited energy availability that is accompanied by significant body mass loss in male subjects with initial low body fat values.","Mäestu, Jarek; Jürimäe, Jaak; Valter, Ivo; Jürimäe, Toivo",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0026-0495,10.1016/j.metabol.2007.09.004,18191052,"Department of Psychology, Centre of Behavioral and Health Sciences, University of Tartu, 50104 Tartu, Estonia. jarek.maestu@ut.ee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18191052,
Comparison of microsatellite length polymorphism and multilocus sequence typing for DNA-Based typing of Candida albicans.,Dec 2007,"For genotyping Candida albicans isolates, two PCR-based methods have recently emerged: multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on the sequence of selected genes, and microsatellite length polymorphism (MLP), based on the length of PCR products containing variable numbers of short DNA repeats. To compare the two methods in their abilities to differentiate and group C. albicans isolates, we selected 50 independent isolates collected at the National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungals. MLST typing was performed using sequencing of seven loci as described at (http://test1.mlst.net). The MLP method consisted of a single multiplex PCR testing three different loci. Dendrograms were constructed by the unweighted pair group cluster method with Euclidean metric for both methods. The correlation between the distance matrices was performed with a Mantel test tested with 1,000 random permutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the MLP typing system were determined after allocating MLST groups for the greater number of isolates of each distinct MLP group. The discriminatory power index was >0.99, and the distances between the isolates were highly correlated with both systems. The Mantel coefficient and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient were 35,699 and 0.32, respectively (P < or = 1.2 x 10(-6)). Using MLP, the average specificity and sensitivity of clustering compared to MLST were 83% and 73%, respectively, when the singletons were excluded. The two methods are similarly discriminatory and can be interchangeable depending on the objectives. MLP is less expensive and faster than MLST. However, MLST is currently more accurate and additional standardization is needed for MLP.","Garcia-Hermoso, Dea; Cabaret, Odile; Lecellier, Gael; Desnos-Ollivier, Marie; Hoinard, Damien; Raoux, Dorothée; Costa, Jean-Marc; Dromer, Françoise; Bretagne, Stéphane",Journal of clinical microbiology,0095-1137,10.1128/JCM.01261-07,17928418,"Centre National de Référence de Mycologie et des Antifongiques, Unité de Mycologie Moléculaire, CNRS URA 3012, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17928418,

Multilocus sequence typing for analyses of clonality of Candida albicans strains in Taiwan.,Jun 2006,"Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize the genetic profiles of 51 Candida albicans isolates collected from 12 hospitals in Taiwan. Among the 51 isolates, 16 were epidemiologically unrelated, 28 were isolates from 11 critically ill, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients, and 7 were long-term serial isolates from 3 HIV-positive patients. Internal regions of seven housekeeping genes were sequenced. A total of 83 polymorphic nucleotide sites were identified. Ten to 20 different genotypes were observed at the different loci, resulting, when combined, in 45 unique genotype combinations or diploid sequence types (DSTs). Thirty (36.1%) of the 83 individual changes were synonymous and 53 (63.9%) were nonsynonymous. Due to the diploid nature of C. albicans, MLST was more discriminatory than the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-BssHII-restricted fragment method in discriminating epidemiologically related strains. MLST is able to trace the microevolution over time of C. albicans isolates in the same patient. All but one of the DSTs of our Taiwanese strain collections were novel to the internet C. albicans DST database (http://test1.mlst.net/). The DSTs of C. albicans in Taiwan were analyzed together with those of the reference strains and of the strains from the United Kingdom and United States by unweighted-pair group method using average linkages and minimum spanning tree.

Regulation of gene expression in intervertebral disc cells by low and high hydrostatic pressure.,Aug 2006,"Intervertebral disc structures are exposed to wide ranges of intradiscal hydrostatic pressure during different loading exercises and are at their minimum during lying or relaxed sitting and at maximum during lifting weights with a round back. We hypothesize that these different loading magnitudes influence the intervertebral disc (IVD) by alteration of disc matrix turnover depending on their magnitudes. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess changes in gene expression of human nucleus cells after the application of low hydrostatic pressure (0.25 MPa) and high hydrostatic pressure (2.5 MPa). IVD cells isolated from the nucleus of human (n = 18) and bovine (n = 24 from four animals) disc biopsies were seeded into three-dimensional collagen type-I matrices and exposed to the different loading magnitudes by specially developed pressure chambers. The lower pressure range (0.25 MPa, 30 min, 0.1 Hz) was applied with a recently published device by using an external compression cylinder. For the application of higher loads (2.5 MPa, 30 min, 0.1 Hz) the cell-loaded collagen gels were sealed into sterile bags with culture medium and stimulated in a newly developed water-filled compression cylinder by using a loading frame. These methods allowed the comparison of loading regimes in a wide physiological range under an equal three-dimensional culture conditions. Cells were harvested 24 h after the end of stimulation and changes in the expression of genes known to influence IVD matrix turnover (collagen-I, collagen-II, aggrecan, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP13) were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test(1) and a Wilcoxon 2-sample test(2) were performed to detect differences between the stimulated and control samples(1) and differences between low and high hydrostatic pressure(2). Multiple testing was considered by adjusting the p value appropriately. Both regimes of hydrostatic pressure influenced gene expression in nucleus cells with opposite tendencies for the matrix forming proteins aggrecan and collagen type-I in response to the two different pressure magnitudes: Low hydrostatic-pressure (0.25 MPa) tended to increase collagen-I and aggrecan expression of human nucleus cells (P < 0.05) but only to a small degree. High hydrostatic pressure (2.5 MPa) tended to decrease gene expression of all anabolic proteins with significant effects on aggrecan expression of nucleus cells (P = 0.004). Low hydrostatic pressure had no influence on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3 and MMP13). In contrast, high hydrostatic pressure tended to increase the expression of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13 of human nucleus cells with high individual-individual variations. The decreased expression of aggrecan (P = 0.008) and collagen type II (P = 0.023) and the increased MMP3 expression (P = 0.008) in response to high hydrostatic pressure could be confirmed in additional experiments with bovine nucleus cells. These results suggest that hydrostatic pressure as one of the physiological stimuli of the IVD may influence matrix turnover in a magnitude dependent way. Low hydrostatic pressure (0.25 MPa) has quite small influences with a tendency to anabolic effects, whereas high hydrostatic pressure (2.5 MPa) tends to decrease the matrix protein expression with a tendency to increase some matrix-turnover enzymes. Therefore, hydrostatic pressure may regulate disc matrix turnover in a dose-dependent way.","Neidlinger-Wilke, Cornelia; Würtz, Karin; Urban, Jill P G; Börm, Wolfgang; Arand, Markus; Ignatius, Anita; Wilke, Hans-Joachim; Claes, Lutz E","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",0940-6719,10.1007/s00586-006-0112-1,16680448,"Institute of Orthopaedic Research and Biomechanics, University of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany. cornelia.neidlinger-wilke@uni-ulm.de",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16680448,

Determination of nicotine and cotinine in tobacco harvesters' urine by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography.,Apr 2004,"A solid-phase extraction method using Drug Test-1 column containing chemically modified silica as a solid support for sample clean up and reversed phase ion-paired high-pressure liquid chromatography method have been developed for the simultaneous determination of nicotine and its metabolite cotinine from the urine samples. Mobile phase was consisted of acetate buffer (containing 0.03 M sodium acetate and 0.1 M acetic acid) pH 3.1 and acetonitrile (78:22% (v/v)) containing 0.02 M sodium octanosulfonate as an ion pair agent. pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 3.6 with triethylamine for better resolution and to prevent peak tailing. The linearity was obtained in the range of 0.5-10 microg/ml concentrations of nicotine and cotinine standards. The correlation coefficients were 0.998 for cotinine and 0.999 for nicotine. The recoveries were obtained in the range of 79-97% with average value of 85% for nicotine and in the range of 82-98% with average value of 88% for cotinine. The limit of detection was 2 ng/ml for cotinine and 5 ng/ml for nicotine with 2 ml urine for extraction, calculated by taking signal to noise ratio 10:3. The intra-day co-efficient of variation (CV) were <4 and 7% and inter-day CV were <9 and 7% for nicotine and cotinine, respectively. The method was applied to the urine samples of tobacco harvesters, who suffer from green tobacco sickness (GTS) to check the absorption of nicotine through dermal route during the various processes of tobacco cultivation due to its good reproducibility and sensitivity.","Doctor, P B; Gokani, V N; Kulkarni, P K; Parikh, J R; Saiyed, H N","Journal of chromatography.

Internal quality control for erythrocyte sedimentation rate measured by TEST-1 Analyzer.,2002,"The TEST 1 is a fully automated analyzer for measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This system employs a particular capillary where blood is moved by a special hydrodynamic system. This original method is not able to measure stabilized samples for quality control, probably because stabilized erythrocytes offer a higher resistance to movement into the capillary, giving a distorted sedimentation curve. We evaluated whether the stability of collected EDTA samples, as declared by the producer company, was sufficient to use samples measured the day before as internal quality control samples. We also evaluated whether different tubes could modify the test results between stored and fresh samples. The difference between ESRs measured in fresh and stored samples are non-relevant after 24h and 48h, using both the tubes considered. The agreement between fresh and stored samples was better than that obtained by comparison with the Westergren method and can be used for the internal quality control procedure.","Giavarina, Davide; Capuzzo, Silvano; Cauduro, Fabrizio; Carta, Mariarosa; Soffiati, Giuliano",Clinical laboratory,1433-6510,,12389704,"Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Laboratory, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza Italy. giavarina@libero.it",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12389704,
Maximum cognitive performance and physiological time trend measurements after caffeine intake.,May 2002,"The effect of caffeine on the central nervous system and cardiorespiratory system was tested under resting conditions and while undertaking a multitask performance test. The subjects abstained from caffeine for a week before the study. Each subject performed the test after oral administration of 90 and 250 mg of caffeine on two separate days. Sum of Squares was recorded during the whole period of the study. Heart rate (HR) and respiration rates (RR) were continuously recorded and blood pressure (BP) was recorded before and after each stage of the experiment (Test(0), Test(1), Test(2), Test(3)). Sixteen healthy volunteers participated in the study divided into three groups: Group A, non-smokers and non-coffee drinkers; Group B, smokers and coffee drinkers; and Group C, non-smokers and coffee drinkers. Comparison of the performance of each stage with the resting conditions revealed statistically significant differences of group B compared to the other two groups and no significant differences between Groups A and C in both doses of caffeine. Non-coffee drinkers needed a low dose of caffeine for their optimal performance while a higher dose significantly increased their blood pressure. Coffee drinkers and smokers needed a higher dose of caffeine for optimal performance, which increased very quickly, but did not last and increased their BP. This increase in BP was not statistically significant, probably because of nicotine's effect. Heart rate was decreased and respiration rate increased significantly. The optimal performance was dose-dependent, increasing significantly with the higher dose of caffeine but with adverse effects on BP and RR.","Kourtidou-Papadeli, Chrysoula; Papadelis, Christos; Louizos, Alexandros Louizos; Guiba-Tziampiri, Olympia",Brain research.

Length of sedimentation reaction in undiluted blood (erythrocyte sedimentation rate): variations with sex and age and reference limits.,May 2001,"Although the length of sedimentation reaction in blood (LSRB) (commonly, but improperly called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR) has long been used in clinical laboratories because it is simple and low-cost, its sensitivity and specificity are unsatisfactory. Usually, the values are reported using the Westergren method with sodium citrate-anticoagulated specimens. We used a new procedure, the TEST1, which measures the length of sedimentation reaction in undiluted K3EDTA anticoagulated blood samples following ICSH (International Committee for Standardization in Haematology) recommendations. Samples obtained from 840 reference individuals (430 females and 410 males, mean age 44 and 46.5 years respectively, range 1 to 90 years) were utilised to estimate the reference limits. The subjects, classified by sex, were subdivided into four statistically different age groups to determine the reference limits (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). Sex difference was statistically significant in two age groups, from 14 to 50 (p < 0.0001) and from 50 to 70 years (p < 0.01). We did not observe significant sex difference within the age bracket from 1 to 14 years and from 70 to 90 years. In both sexes LSRB values increased with age, in significant correlation with fibrinogen concentration (p < 0.0001), and became significantly higher in subjects older than 70 compared to all the younger subjects (p<0.01 in females and p < 0.02 in males). Thus, we defined adequate reference ranges in elderly.","Piva, E; Sanzari, M C; Servidio, G; Plebani, M",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,1434-6621,10.1515/CCLM.2001.071,11434396,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital of Padua, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11434396,
Preventive effect of 2 and 10 mg of sodium cromoglycate on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.,Oct 2000,"This double-blind, randomised and cross-over study was designed to compare the preventive effect against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), defined as the percentage decrease in FEV1 > or = 15% after 6 min of exercise, of 2 mg and 10 mg of sodium cromoglycate (SCG), administered through a metered dose inhaler via spacer, in asthmatic children. Each of the 30 subject (age 11.6 +/- 3.2 years) was tested on five occasions. For inclusion, EIB in test1 was required. In tests 2 to 5, all subjects inhaled 2 mg or 10 mg of SCG 20 min and 120 min before exercise in a randomised order. In order to assess excretion of eosinophil protein X (EPX) accompanying EIB, urine samples were collected before and after exercise. The mean percentage fall in FEV1 (+/- SD) in test 1 was 26.8 +/- 9.8%. Inhalation of 2 mg and 10 mg of SCG 20 min before exercise provided a significant preventive effect in 83% and 77% and inhalation 120 min before exercise provided a preventive effect in 63% and 70%, respectively (n = 30). Variance analysis did not reveal a statistically different absolute fall in FEV1 after exercise when both doses (120 min before exercise) were compared (P = 0.356). In an unselected subgroup of 12 children, urinary EPX increased after the challenge without SCG premedication (test 1) (mean change: +48.7 micrograms/mmol creatinine, P = 0.034), whereas no significant increase was found in case of SCG premedication (mean change in microgram/mmol creatinine): 2 mg/20 min: +12.1; 2 mg/120 min: +8.5; 10 mg/20 min: -10.4 and 10 mg/120 min: -23.5; P > 0.1).","Storm van's Gravesande, K; Mattes, J; Grossklauss, E; Zurmühl, A; Moseler, M; Kühr, J",European journal of pediatrics,0340-6199,10.1007/pl00008341,11039131,"University Children's Hospital Freiburg, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11039131,
[Reproducibility in induced sputum in children with asthma].,May 2000,"In asthmatic children sputum-induction with hypertonic saline is useful to quantify the eosinophilic inflammation. However, only few data are available about feasibility and safety of the procedure in children. Therefore, taking 9 non-atopic healthy control children (mean age 11.8 years) and 34 asthmatic children (mean age 11.4 years), inhaling n = 25 Budesonid (400-1200 micrograms/die) and n = 9 DNCG (60 mg/die), sputum induction was performed twice within 6 weeks. Briefly, 10 minutes after inhalation of 200 micrograms salbutamol subjects inhaled hypertonic saline (3, 4 and 5%) for in all 30 minutes, while all 5 minutes lung function was checked and expectoration of sputum was supported. Adequate sputum plugs were separated from contaminating saliva and processed immediately employing native chamber and cytospin cell count as well as measurement of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP). Sputum-induction could be performed in 84 out of 86 planed tests (97.7%) without any objective clinical adverse effects. The mean fall in FEV1 was 3.0%, the maximum 11.0%. The reproducibility of eosinophil, neutrophil and lymphocyte differential cell count (5-95%-values Test1: 0.0-4.2%, 0.8-11.4%, and 3.2-35.1%, respectively) was moderate for eosinophils and neutrophils (Intraclass-Correlation-Coefficient (ICC) 0.41) as well as for lymphocytes (ICC = 0.49). For ECP 5-95%-values Test1: 39.8-8000.0 micrograms/l) only a fair reproducibility (ICC = 0.24) was found. The ICC levels for total cell count (ICC = 0.31) and for weight of the sputum plug (ICC = 0.30) were also fair. Based on the procedure presented induced sputum is a feasible and safe method in childhood. The differential sputum cell count of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes can be recommended as parameters with moderate reproducibility.","Reining, U; Mattes, J; Storm van's Gravesande, K; Ihorst, G; Kühr, J","Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)",0934-8387,10.1055/s-2000-3828,10865471,"Universitäts-Kinderklinik, Zentrum für Pneumologie, Allergologie und Mukoviszidose, Freiburg.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10865471,

[Effect of conditioning on the circulation of rat teeth].,Mar 2000,"Materials employed in ""adhesive filling technique"" often lack informative instructions concerning the depth of cavities which require lining. Etching-materials directly placed on the dentin can adversely influence the pulp leading to changes in local microcirculation which can be an early sign of the pathological changes in the pulp. Therefore, it is worth examining the effect of these materials on the diameters of pulpal vessels. In the present study we examined wether acid etching (test1: 15 s and test2: 60 s) alters the blood circulation of the pulp lower incisors, by applying it directly onto a thin layer of pulpal wall (40-50 microns) without any liner, and following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 330 +/- 51 g) and the technique of vitalmicroscopy was used for this investigation. The left lower incisors of the rats were prepared for vitalmicroscopy. Changes in vessel diameter were recorded prior to and 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after investigated materials or saline (control) were administered on dentin. In control and test1 group the vessel diameter was unchanged during the experiment. However, in group test2 an intense vasoconstriction was registered. There were significant (p > 0.05, ANOVA) differences in diameter changes between the control group and those treated with acid etching for 60s. Our results suggest that extended etching time may affect the circulatory system in the dental pulp, when applied onto very thin layer of dentin.","Iványi, I; Kispélyi, B; Lázár, A; Balogh, A; Rosivall, L; Nyárasdy, I",Fogorvosi szemle,0015-5314,,10769491,"Semmelweis Orvostudományi Egyetem, Budapest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10769491,

In control rats, the vessel diameter was stable during the experiment. However, in the presence of bonding materials an enhancement was registered in vascular diameter (p < 0.05). The bond materials applied directly onto a very thin layer of dentin show acute vasodilating effect on the rat pulpal microvessels, but no stasis or prestasis has been detected, indicating a possible reversible effect. We could not show any statistical difference between the vasodilatation caused by the acetone containing and the acetone free bonding material.","Iványi, I; Balogh, A E; Rosivall, L; Nyárasdy, I",Fogorvosi szemle,0015-5314,,10375850,"Semmelweis Orvostudományi Egyetem, Konzerváló Fogászati Klinika, Budapest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10375850,
Bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of two monofluorophosphate preparations with calcium supplement.,Dec 1998,"Two studies on the rate and extent of bioavailability of fluoride from a single dose of oral preparations of sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2FPO3) combined with calcium supplement were conducted according to a cross-over design on 18 (Study 1) and 20 (Study 2) male healthy volunteers, respectively. Evaluated were: a) tablets containing 76 mg Na2FPO3 (Ref1); b) chewable tablets containing 76 mg Na2FPO3 and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (Test 1); c) effervescent tablets containing 76 mg Na2FPO and 3240 mg calcium lactogluconate/carbonate (Ref 2); d) effervescent tablets containing 76 mg Na2FPO3 and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (Test 2). In all preparations Na2FPO3 was equivalent to 10 mg elemental F. The calcium supplement was equivalent to 500 mg elemental Ca. Fluoride was assayed in serum and in urine by a gas chromatographic method with a limit of quantitation of 10 ng/ml. Test 1 was found equivalent to Ref1 with regard to rate and extent of bioavailability of fluoride in serum. Test 2 (effervescent tablets resulting in an oral solution of Na2FPO3 and calcium salts) was found bioequivalent in rate and extent to Ref2 (effervescent tablets authorized for marketing with the same content in F and Ca equivalents as Test 2). The pharmacokinetics of fluoride from all investigated preparations was characterized by a short lag time, a rapid absorption, a Cmax of fluoride of 291-351 ng/ml (without significant differences between preparations) reached 30-75 min after administration, and a terminal t1/2 of 6-14 h. About 50% of the absorbed fluoride was eliminated with the urine (from 0 to infinity time). The kur.el was 0.06 h-1. The renal clearance 65 ml/min. The preparations were well tolerated by the subjects. In conclusion, Test1 and Test2 represent combinations of Na2FPO3 with calcium supplement which are well tolerated and provide a rapid, reliable and practically complete bioavailability of fluoride. They are therefore suitable for the bone-forming therapy of osteoporosis.","Setnikar, I; Rovati, L C; Schmid, K; Vens-Cappell, B; Barkworth, M F",Arzneimittel-Forschung,0004-4172,,9893933,"Rotta Research Laboratorium, Monza, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9893933,
No induction of chromosome aberrations in human spermatozoa exposed to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields.,May 1998,"Clastogenic effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) on human sperm chromosomes were studied using an interspecific in vitro fertilization system with zona-free golden hamster oocytes. Semen samples from healthy men were exposed to ELF-EMFs (50 Hz, 20 mT) for 2 h at 37 degreesC under 5% CO2 in air. The samples were then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for shipment to a cytogenetic laboratory. After thawing the samples, motile spermatozoa were collected using a continuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation and then capacitated for in vitro fertilization with hamster oocytes. Sperm-derived chromosomes were analyzed at first cleavage metaphase. The present experiment was performed twice using semen samples from two different donors. In test-1, incidence of spermatozoa that displayed structural chromosome aberrations was 17.0% (35/206) in the exposed group and 20.8% (55/264) in the control group. In test-2, structural chromosome aberrations were observed in 11.1% (13/117) of exposed spermatozoa and 13.8% (13/94) of spermatozoa in the control group. In both tests, there was no significant difference in the incidence of chromosomally abnormal spermatozoa between the exposed group and the control group. Types of aberrations observed and their incidences per spermatozoon in the exposed group were similar to those of the control group. Despite the small sample size, the present results suggest that ELF-EMFs have no clastogenic effect on human sperm chromosomes.","Tateno, H; Iijima, S; Nakanishi, Y; Kamiguchi, Y; Asaka, A",Mutation research,0027-5107,10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00036-9,9630495,"Department of Biological Sciences, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa 078-8510, Japan. htateno@asahikawa-med.ac.jp",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9630495,

Effects of prenatal stress on suckling calves.,Dec 1997,"Pregnant Brahman cows (n = 42), bred to either Brahman or Tuli bulls, were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: 1) transported in a stock trailer for 24.2 km, unloaded at a second farm and penned for 1 h, and then returned to the original farm (TRANS); 2) i.v. injection of ACTH, 1 IU/kg BW (ACTH); or 3) walked through the handling facilities (SHAM). Treatments were initiated on d 60 and repeated at 80, 100, 120, and 140 d of gestation. The calves from these cows were subjected to tests to measure their capacity to react to stress. In Test 1, Tuli-sired calves were restrained at 10 and 150 d of age for 3.5 h. In Test 2, Brahman-sired calves were restrained for 3.5 h and given an injection of ACTH (.125 IU ACTH/kg of BW). In Test 3, Test-2 calves were restrained at 180 d of age and hot-iron branded. In Test 4, Test-1 calves were restrained at 180 d of age and given an injection of cortisol (6.7 ng/kg BW) to estimate cortisol clearance rate. During all tests, calves were restrained for 3.5 h, and heart rates were recorded and blood samples were taken at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. The 10- and 150-d-old TRANS calves maintained greater plasma cortisol in Test 1 (restraint) than the ACTH and SHAM calves (P < .01). The ACTH challenge (Test 2) increased plasma cortisol and ACTH, but cow treatment did not alter the response (P > .4). In response to branding (Test 3), the TRANS, ACTH, and SHAM calves' overall mean plasma cortisol was not affected by treatment (52, 51, and 43 +/- 3 ng/mL, respectively; P > .1), nor was the calves' overall heart rate (91, 94, and 86 +/- 3 beats/min, respectively; P > . 1). In Test 4, TRANS calves cleared plasma of cortisol at a slower rate than did the SHAM calves (P < .01), but not the ACTH calves (261, 374, and 473 +/- 50 mL/min, respectively; P > .1). The TRANS calves had an overall greater heart rate than did the ACTH or the SHAM calves (91, 79, and 77 +/- 2 beats/min, respectively; P < .001). Exposing cows to repeated transportation stress during gestation altered their calf's physiological response to stress, and these alterations could have a profound influence on the calfs ability to adapt to stress, thereby influencing its welfare. Further research should examine the growth, immune function, and reproductive function of prenatally stressed calves to determine whether these changes in plasma cortisol are beneficial or deleterious.","Lay, D C; Randel, R D; Friend, T H; Jenkins, O C; Neuendorff, D A; Bushong, D M; Lanier, E K; Bjorge, M K",Journal of animal science,0021-8812,10.2527/1997.75123143x,9419987,"Texas A & M University Agricultural Research & Extension Center, Overton 75684-0038, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9419987,

Effect of weight loss and refeeding diet composition on anaerobic performance in wrestlers.,Oct 1996,"Collegiate wrestlers (N = 12) consumed a formula, hypoenergy diet (18 kcal.kg-1, 60% carbohydrate) without dehydration for 72 h. For the next 5 h, the athletes were fed either a 75% (HC) or a 47% (MC) carbohydrate formula diet of 21 kcal.kg-1. Each wrestler performed three anaerobic arm ergometer performance tests (TEST1, before weight loss; TEST2, after weight loss; TEST3, after refeeding). Blood withdrawn just before and after each test was analyzed for pH, bicarbonate, base excess, glucose, and lactate. Both groups had a similar significant reduction in total work done during TEST2 (92.4% of TEST1). Work done in TEST3 by HC was 99.1% of TEST1 while MC did 91.5% of their initial work (P = 0.1). Peak power was unaffected by the treatment. Plasma lactate significantly increased during the performance test from 1.72 to 21.91 mmol.l-1 as did plasma glucose from 4.88 to 5.25 mmol.l-1 when groups and trials were collapsed. Lactate accumulation was diminished during TEST2 compared with the other tests. Although the exercise bout reduced pH, bicarbonate, and base excess, there was no difference in the effect by group. In conclusion, weight loss by energy restriction significantly reduced anaerobic performance of wrestlers. Those on a high carbohydrate refeeding diet tended to recover their performance while those on a moderate carbohydrate diet did not. The changes in performance were not explained by the acid/base parameters measured.","Rankin, J W; Ocel, J V; Craft, L L",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,0195-9131,10.1097/00005768-199610000-00013,8897387,"Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg 24061-0351, USA. jrankin@vt.edu",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8897387,

The results demonstrate a positive correlation between the tests, and this allows confidence in the use of this test by non-specialists as a screening instrument.","Enderby, P; Crow, E",Disability and rehabilitation,0963-8288,10.3109/09638289609166307,8743301,"Speech and Language Therapy Research Unit, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8743301,
Serological screening tests for syphilis in pregnancy: results of a five year study (1983-87) in the Oxford region.,Dec 1989,"Between 1983 and 1987, 62 out of 76519 pregnancies in 51 mothers had a positive miniaturised Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) test--1 in 1234, or 0.81 per 1000 births. About two thirds of these mothers had syphilis and the remainder non-venereal treponematoses such as yaws or pinta. Antenatal screening identified 13 patients with previously unknown acquired syphilis, 11 of whom were given antibiotics during pregnancy. There were six fetal losses among the 62 TPHA positive pregnancies, but none had evidence of congenital syphilis. No live born child in this study group showed stigmata of congenital syphilis. It is concluded that despite the current low incidence of syphilis in the United Kingdom it is imperative to continue antenatal serological screening and to emphasise the importance of early adequate treatment of the infection.","Bowell, P; Mayne, K; Puckett, A; Entwistle, C; Selkon, J",Journal of clinical pathology,0021-9746,10.1136/jcp.42.12.1281,2515214,"Regional Blood Transfusion Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2515214,
Tear film flow and stability in normal Indian subjects.,1989,"Tear film flow and stability studies were carried out in healthy population by Schirmer's test-1 and tear film break-up-time (BUT) measurements, respectively. The mean BUT observed was 13.87 +/- 4.79 seconds; however, in 22 percent of cases the values of BUT were even less than the lowest values laid down by various workers, from the Western countries. Maximum dry spots were located in the temporal quadrant.","Maudgil, S S; Khurana, A K; Singh, M; Parmar, I P; Ahluwalia, B K",Indian journal of ophthalmology,0301-4738,,2638306,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2638306,
The prospective diagnostic value of real-time cholecystosonography.,Aug 1985,"A series of 82 consecutive patients scheduled for operation, with pre-operatively obtained P.O. cholecystography and in some cases also I.V. cholangiography, is presented. All patients had cholecystosonography performed ""blindly"" the day prior to the operation (76 had a cholecystectomy and six had a vagotomy). Based upon the operative findings, the diagnostic value of ultrasonic examination for gallstones can be calculated to predictive value of positive test--1.00; predictive value of negative test--0.71. The diagnostic failures are discussed but it is not possible to predict which patients will benefit more from peroral cholecystography rather than from ultrasound. It is concluded that cholecystosonography is a safe alternative to peroral cholecystography.","Jensen, F; Jensen, B; Hahn, L",European journal of radiology,0720-048X,,3896796,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3896796,

Preliminary characterization of a colon tumour tissue preparation used in macrophage electrophoretic mobility (MEM) test1.,1981,A 3M KC1-extract on nine samples of colon carcinomas was freed from human serum proteins by immunoadsorption. Both the KC1-extract and the immunoadsorbed preparation of this KC1-extract were used in MEM test and gave characteristic reaction patterns. The two preparations were compared and preliminarily characterized by immunological and electrophoretical methods.,"Grossmann, H; Müller, M; Heidl, G; Irmscher, J; Kotzsch, M; Wagner, H",Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0003-911X,,7032449,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7032449,
Lidar observations during dusty infrared Test-1.,Jul 1980,"Lidar measurements using ruby (0.7-microm) and CO(2) (10.6-microm) lidar systems during the dustry IR Test-1 are described. The test was conducted at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in October 1978. Transmission comparisons are made between the two wavelengths through dust and smoke clouds generated by artillery barrages, TNT explosions, and oil-rubber fire in a test zone midway (1 km) along the lidar path. A target at the end of the lidar path provided a reference backscatter return for the transmission measurements. Results indicate that the broad particle size distribution present in the dust generated at WSMR produced little if any wavelength-dependent transmission effects.","Randhawa, J S; Van der Laan, J E",Applied optics,1559-128X,10.1364/AO.19.002291,20234413,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20234413,
Stationarity and normality test for biomedical data.,Dec 1977,"Biomedical data, such as EEG, EMG and neural impulse sequences, are regarded as the stochastic phenomena of biological systems, and the statistical properties of such time series are often examined. Most of the statistical analysis processed in the frequency and the time domain are based on the assumption that the time series is weakly stationary and normally distributed. Therefore, as the basis of the statistical analysis of the biomedical data, it is necessary to know whether they satisfy the conditions of weak stationarity and normality. However, impulse response and evoked potential biomedical data, are not regarded as the stationary time series. Therefore, other analysis is required. In this paper, the authors present four programs, TEST1, TEST2, TEST3 and TEST4, to examine above conditions. Furthermore, in order to clarify the characteristic of each program, the time series were generated by the computer and examined by the test programs.","Sugimoto, H; Ishii, N; Iwata, A; Suzumura, N",Computer programs in biomedicine,0010-468X,10.1016/0010-468x(77)90045-9,340124,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/340124,
A modified rapid slide test for anti-streptolysin O.,Jun 1972,This paper describes the modification of a commercially available rapid slide screening test(1) for anti-streptolysin O to give quantitative results. The modified technique is compared with the long-established haemolytic technique of Rantz and Randall (1945). The quantitative results for both techniques are shown to be comparable. The modified slide test offers the advantage of saving time and labour.,"Ingram, G B; Hughes, J E",Journal of clinical pathology,0021-9746,10.1136/jcp.25.6.543,5043380,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5043380,
