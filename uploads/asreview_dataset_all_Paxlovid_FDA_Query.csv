67,"Virological Characterization of Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: Interactions of Viral Load, Antibody Status, and B.1.1.7 Infection",,"Background. Convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. We report diverse virological characteristics of UK intensive care patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomized controlled trial that potentially influence treatment outcomes. Methods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs collected pretreatment was quantified by PCR. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains using allele-specific probes or restriction site polymorphism (SfcI) targeting D1118H. Results. Of 1274 subjects, 90% were PCR positive with viral loads 118-1.7 x 1011IU/mL. Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those IgG seronegative (n = 354; 28%) compared to seropositives (n = 939; 72%). Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from < 1% in November 2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians 5.8 x 106 and 2.0 x 105 IU/mL, respectively; P = 2 x 10-15). Conclusions. High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects and resistance to seroconversion indicate less effective clearance by innate and adaptive immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 strain, viral loads, and antibody status define subgroups for analysis of treatment efficacy.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Ratcliff J.; Nguyen D.; Fish M.; Rynne J.; Jennings A.; Williams S.; Al-Beidh F.; Bonsall D.; Evans A.; Golubchik T.; Gordon A.C.; Lamikanra A.; Tsang P.; Ciccone N.A.; Leuscher U.; Slack W.; Laing E.; Mouncey P.R.; Ziyenge S.; Oliveira M.; Ploeg R.; Rowan K.M.; Shankar-Hari M.; Roberts D.J.; Menon D.K.; Estcourt L.; Simmonds P.; Harvala H.,,0022-1899,/10.1093/infdis/jiab283,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1093%2finfdis%2fjiab283,1,1,,1
11,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Kinetics Among Immunologically Naive Adults: Comparison by Variant and Reinfection Status,,"Background. SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics offer insights into clinical trajectories and immune responses. While research has explored SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics by variant and immune status, changes in population immunity make results difficult to interpret. Here, we examined SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics in a community-based cohort of immunologically naive adults. Methods. Unvaccinated adults 30 to 64 years of age without prior infection were followed for <= 72 weeks. Subjects submitted weekly nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR; if symptomatic or positive, swabs were collected every other day (up to 14 days). We examined RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) results from infections with sufficient data, defined as >= 3 swabs collected between ?10 and 28 days of the peak Ct value with >= 1 Ct< 30. Bayesian hierarchical piecewise models were used to estimate viral kinetics by variant (classified by date) or first vs. second infections using data from peak swabs and those collected within +/-3 days of another swab; if negative, Ct values were set to the detection limit and only the first of consecutive negatives were included. Results. Sufficient data were available for 179/187 (96%) first SARS-CoV-2 infections, with 27 (15%) Delta, 132 (74%) Omicron BA.1/BA.2, and 20 (11%) Omicron BA.4/BA.5 infections. Of these, 35 (20%) subjects had a second infection while unvaccinated (32 [91%] sufficient data). Figure 1 shows Ct values and model predictions by variant or infection status. Lower mean peak Ct values were found for first vs. second infections (?5.7, 95% CI: ?7.4, ?4.1 cycles), and suggested for Delta vs. Omicron BA.1/ BA.2 infections (?1.4, 95% CI: ?3.0, 0.5 cycles). Delta had a shorter mean time to peak (?2.5, 95% CI: ?3.8, ?1.3 days) and longer clearance (2.7, 95% CI: 0.7, 4.9 days) vs. Omicron BA.1/BA.2 infections; first infections had longer clearance (3.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.3 days) vs. second infections. Conclusion. Modeled estimates suggest Delta infections experienced higher viral loads, shorter time to peak, and longer clearance times compared with Omicron BA.1/ BA.2. First infections had higher viral loads and longer clearance times vs. second infections. As population immunity is dynamic, characterizing viral kinetics among immunologically naive individuals is valuable to inform SARS-CoV-2 trajectories.",Doll M.K.; Shakoor B.L.; Kimball L.E.; Crukley J.; Ozbek N.; Blazevic R.L.; Mose L.; Boonyaratanakornkit J.; Stevens-Ayers T.L.; Cornell K.; Sheppard B.D.; Hampson E.; Sharmin F.; Goodwin B.; Dan J.M.; Archie T.; O'Connor T.; Boeckh M.J.; Crotty S.; Waghmare A.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.1913,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofad500.1913,1,0,,2
134,SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity protects against reinfection for at least seven months with 95% efficacy.,2021 May,"BACKGROUND: Reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns.

91,OAB-047: Plasma cell disorder patients are left vulnerable after one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA or the ChAdOx-nCOV-19 COVID-19 vaccines,,"Background: Concerns have been raised about the ability of patients with plasma cell disorders (PCD) to mount adequate immune responses to vaccination, particularly considering the initial extension to vaccination intervals in the United Kingdom to up to 12 weeks in December 2020, the start of the vaccination roll-out. Protecting this vulnerable patient group with anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is critical. Method(s): We measured the humoral responses in PCD patients after the first dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx-1 nCOV-19 vaccines. Antibody levels were measured using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2S assay for quantitative detection of IgG Abs, specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein receptor binding domain. Positive cut-off of >=0.80 U/mL defined serologic response. Testing was performed at (or closest to) 4 and 8 weeks post-dose. Baseline nucleocapsid Ab results were available from previous screening in a subset of patients. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records. Result(s): 198 PCD patients (178 multiple myeloma, 15 amyloid, 3 SMM/MGUS, other 2 PCD), median age 63 (range 35-84), had serologic assessment after one vaccine dose against SARS-CoV-2. 69% (138) were on chemo-immunotherapy treatment (CIT) within 4 weeks of first dose. Previous COVID-19 infection and exposure was defined as a positive COVID-19 PCR swab or positive N-antibody at baseline and were excluded from analysis. Patients were tested at median 42 days (range 11-90) after their first dose. After one dose, 68% (135/198) were seropositive, with median Ab titres 21 U/mL (IQR 3.92-133.5). In those with negative baseline Ab test, seroconversion to one dose was 67% (64/96). Forty-one patients were tested more than once after one dose, at median 33 days (12-62) and again at 67 days (38-91). 22 were seronegative at first testing, of these, 6 seroconverted on second testing, prior to second dose. Age >=70, light chain (LC) disease, disease status less than VGPR, CIT within 4 weeks, low IgM and ASCT more than 12m were statistically significant seronegative predictors on univariate analyses. LC disease, less than VGPR and IgM less than 0.4g/L, retained statistical significance on multivariate analyses. On linear regression analysis in seropositive patients, more lines of treatment and CIT within 4 weeks were significantly associated with lower antibody titres. Conclusion(s): Serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is lower in PCD patients than reported healthy controls at 68% after one dose. Further work in PCD is needed to understand how Ab levels correlate to neutralisation capability, cellular responses, protection from infection and how long seroconversion lasts to better define correlates of protection. Nearly a third do not respond to a single vaccine dose causing concerns that PCD patients are left vulnerable with a delayed vaccination strategy and should be prioritised to receiving the second dose at the recommended manufacturers time scale of 3 or 4 weeks.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Chan W.Y.; Howells L.; Wilson W.; Sanchez E.; Ainley L.; Chavda S.; Dowling E.; Correia N.; Lecat C.; McMillan A.; Wisniowski B.; Mahmood S.; Papanikolaou X.; Lee L.; Sive J.; Kyriakou C.; Wechalekar A.; Popat R.; Rabin N.; Nastouli E.; Yong K.; Xu K.,,2152-2650,/10.1016/S2152-2650%2821%2902121-2,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fS2152-2650%252821%252902121-2,1,0,,4
103,Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2-infected children developing neutralising antibodies,,"Background: Further knowledge on adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) in children is needed in order to define possible immunization strategies and reconsider pandemic control measures. We analyzed anti-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab) and their neutralizing activity (PRNT), alongside antigen (Ag) specific cellular response, in relation to virus load in nasopharyngeal swabs. Method(s): We analysed 42 CoV-2 patients at 7 days after symptoms onset. CoV-2 viral load (VL) was measured by RT-PCR and digital droplet PCR on longitudinal samples of nasopharyngeal swabs (NP). Virus infectivity (FFU) was tested by virus focus forming assay. CoV-2 antibodies were investigated by Diasorin (CoV-2 Ab) and neutralization assay (PRNT). CoV-2-specific CD4-CD40L+ T-cells and Spike specific B-cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Plasma proteomic profiling was measured by 2 Olink panels. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the viral load from NP collected every 48 hours up to undetectable VL. Mann-Whitney was used to compare means in individuals with neutralizing activity (PRNT+) or not (PRNT-); linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between virus load and infectivity over time. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyse proteomic data. Result(s): Higher VL was found in seronegative patients expressed in terms of both CoV-2 Ab (p=0.003) and PRNT (p=0.0007). Similarly, lower FFU was associated with higher CoV-2 Ab (p=0.003; rho=-0.67) and PRNT (p=0.023; rho=-0.46). Further, the AUC of the viral load in NP showed an inverse correlation with CoV-2 Ab (p=0.031; rho=-0.54). Development of humoral response was associated with the presence of CoV-2 specific IgD-CD27+ B cells, with a higher frequency of CoV-2 specific B cells found in seropositive compared to seronegative (p=0.001). Besides, individuals developing neutralizing Ab had higher frequency CD4-CD40L+ T-cells compared to PRNT- (p=0.03). The plasma proteome confirmed the association between cellular and humoral CoV-2 immunity, with PRNT+ showing higher viral signal transduction molecules (SLAMF1, CD244, CLEC4G). Conclusion(s): This work provides a virological and immunological characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infected children presenting a differential Abmediated neutralizing activity. It demonstrates that children with neutralizing antibodies present reduced viral load, faster virus clearance and lower in vitro infectivity. These data provide information that can drive vaccination endpoints and quarantine measures policies.",Ruggiero A.; Cotugno N.; Francesco B.; Petrara M.R.; Pascucci G.R.; Santilli V.; Manno E.; Concato C.; Linardos G.; Dona D.; Giaquinto C.; Brodin P.; Rossi P.; De Rossi A.; Palma P.,,2161-5853,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&AN=635068379,1,0,,5
143,Anti-spike antibody response to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population.,2021 10 29,"Understanding the trajectory, duration, and determinants of antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform subsequent protection and risk of reinfection, however large-scale representative studies are limited. Here we estimated antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population using representative data from 7,256 United Kingdom COVID-19 infection survey participants who had positive swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from 26-April-2020 to 14-June-2021. A latent class model classified 24% of participants as 'non-responders' not developing anti-spike antibodies, who were older, had higher SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values during infection (i.e. lower viral burden), and less frequently reported any symptoms. Among those who seroconverted, using Bayesian linear mixed models, the estimated anti-spike IgG peak level was 7.3-fold higher than the level previously associated with 50% protection against reinfection, with higher peak levels in older participants and those of non-white ethnicity. The estimated anti-spike IgG half-life was 184 days, being longer in females and those of white ethnicity. We estimated antibody levels associated with protection against reinfection likely last 1.5-2 years on average, with levels associated with protection from severe infection present for several years. These estimates could inform planning for vaccination booster strategies. Copyright © 2021.

42,"Immune responses, viral shedding, and COVID-19 symptom burden from breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccination",,"Background. Breakthrough infections post-COVID-19 vaccination increase with waning immunity and typically produce milder disease than infections in unvaccinated individuals. We investigated immuno-virologic responses and COVID-19 symptom burden upon breakthrough infection in participants from a Phase 3 study of 2-dose primary series AZD1222 vaccination (NCT04516746) to explore disease attenuation. Methods. Study participants who experienced protocol-defined COVID-19 symptoms initiated a series of illness visits over 28 days with collection of sera, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and saliva samples (SS), and documentation of symptoms (data-cut off: July 30, 2021). For baseline-seronegative participants with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection >=15 days after dose 2 of AZD1222 or placebo we assessed: anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and neutralizing antibody (Ab) titers by multiplex immunoassay and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay in sera; viral load by quantitative RT-PCR in NP swabs; and viral shedding by qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR in SS. Data were stratified by age and SARS-CoV-2 variant, and time since primary series dose 2. Results. Illness Day 1 (ILL-D1) S Ab GMTs in AZD1222 vaccinees were similar to peak GMTs seen 14 days after dose 2 of AZD1222 and were higher vs placebo at all timepoints. The magnitude of S Ab response differed by age: median GMTs were lower at ILL-D1 and higher at ILL-D14 in vaccinees aged >=65 vs 18-64 years (Fig.1). ILL-D1 overall, SARS-CoV-2 ancestral, alpha, and epsilon variant viral load titers in NP swabs were lower in vaccinees vs placebo (Fig 2). Mean viral load in NP swabs and viral shedding titers in SS were lower in vaccinees vs placebo at all timepoints. Vaccinees reported fewer COVID-19 symptoms than placebo participants, and experienced shorter symptom duration, particularly for fatigue and difficulty breathing. Figure 1.

Quantification of viral load (nasopharyngeal swabs quantitative viral titer) by SARS- CoV-2 variant at Illness Visit Day 1 Conclusion. Improved S Ab responses, lower viral loads, and reduced symptom burden upon breakthrough infection in vaccinees vs placebo recipients, suggest that robust recall responses to AZD1222 vaccination may attenuate COVID-19 disease severity and duration. These findings alongside data on cellular immune responses to breakthrough infection will inform understanding of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Sobieszczyk M.E.; Falsey A.R.; Luetkemeyer A.F.; Paulsen G.C.; Riddler S.A.; Robb M.L.; Rolle C.-P.M.; Sha B.E.; Tong T.; Ahani B.; Aksyuk A.A.; Bansal H.; Green J.A.; Jepson B.; Maaske J.; Shoemaker K.; Sproule S.; Stanley A.M.; Wilkins D.; Villafana T.L.; Kelly E.J.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofac492.1579,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofac492.1579,1,0,,7
133,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over six months among Nicaraguan outpatients.,2021 Apr 29,"New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June-October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.",Gonzalez F; Zepeda O; Toval-Ruiz C; Matute A; Vanegas H; Munguia N; Centeno E; Reyes Y; Svensson L; Nordgren J; de Silva AM; Becker-Dreps S; Premkumar L; Bucardo F,,,/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256122,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=pmnm6&DO=10.1101%2f2021.04.28.21256122,1,0,,9
65,"The Duration, Dynamics, and Determinants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibody Responses in Individual Healthcare Workers",,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary. Method(s): We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning. Result(s): Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, for example, in 94% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% CrI 19-31) days post first polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titer, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95% CrI 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titers were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity, and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months and fall faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.Copyright © 2021",Lumley S.F.; Wei J.; Odonnell D.; Stoesser N.E.; Matthews P.C.; Howarth A.; Hatch S.B.; Marsden B.D.; Cox S.; James T.; Peck L.J.; Ritter T.G.; De Toledo Z.; Cornall R.J.; Jones E.Y.; Stuart D.I.; Screaton G.; Ebner D.; Hoosdally S.; Crook D.W.; Conlon C.P.; Pouwels K.B.; Walker A.S.; Peto T.E.A.; Walker T.M.; Jeffery K.; Eyre D.W.,,1058-4838,/10.1093/cid/ciab004,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1093%2fcid%2fciab004,1,0,,10
78,Prevalence and incidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers in Belgian hospitals before vaccination: a prospective cohort study,,"Objectives To describe prevalence and incidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Belgian hospital healthcare workers (HCW) in April-December 2020. Design Prospective cohort study. Follow-up was originally planned until September and later extended. Setting Multicentre study, 17 hospitals. Participants 50 HCW were randomly selected per hospital. HCW employed beyond the end of the study and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. 850 HCW entered the study in April-May 2020, 673 HCW (79%) attended the September visit and 308 (36%) the December visit. Outcome measures A semiquantitative ELISA was used to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum (Euroimmun) at 10 time points. In seropositive samples, neutralising antibodies were measured using a virus neutralisation test. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swabs. Participant characteristics and the presence of symptoms were collected via an online questionnaire. Results Among all participants, 80% were women, 60% nurses and 21% physicians. Median age was 40 years. The seroprevalence remained relatively stable from April (7.7% (95% CI: 4.8% to 12.1%) to September (8.2% (95% CI: 5.7% to 11.6%)) and increased thereafter, reaching 19.7% (95% CI: 12.0% to 30.6%) in December 2020. 76 of 778 initially seronegative participants seroconverted during the follow-up (incidence: 205/1000 person-years). Among all seropositive individuals, 118/148 (80%) had a positive neutralisation test, 83/147 (56%) presented or reported a positive RT-qPCR, and 130/147 (88%) reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms at least once. However, only 46/73 (63%) of the seroconverters presented COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the month prior to seroconversion. Conclusions The seroprevalence among hospital HCW was slightly higher than that of the general Belgian population but followed a similar evolution, suggesting that infection prevention and control measures were effective and should be strictly maintained. After two SARS-CoV-2 waves, 80% of HCW remained seronegative, justifying their prioritisation in the vaccination strategy.

80,SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study,,"Background: Whether young adults who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of subsequent infection is uncertain. We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. Method(s): This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18-20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot-Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). Finding(s): Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28; p<0.001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.32-0.65]; p<0.001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 3.95 [95% CI 1.23-6.67]; p=0.004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies.

139,Long-Term Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Children.,2023 01,"Almost 2 years into the pandemic and with vaccination of children significantly lagging behind adults, long-term pediatric humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are understudied. The C19.CHILD Hamburg (COVID-19 Child Health Investigation of Latent Disease) Study is a prospective cohort study designed to identify and follow up children and their household contacts infected in the early 2020 first wave of SARS-CoV-2. We screened 6113 children < 18 years by nasopharyngeal swab-PCR in a low-incidence setting after general lockdown, from May 11 to June 30, 2020. A total of 4657 participants underwent antibody testing. Positive tests were followed up by repeated PCR and serological testing of all household contacts over 6 months. In total, the study identified 67 seropositive children (1.44%); the median time after infection at first presentation was 83 days post-symptom onset (PSO). Follow-up of household contacts showed less than 100% seroprevalence in most families, with higher seroprevalence in families with adult index cases compared to pediatric index cases (OR 1.79, P = 0.047). Most importantly, children showed sustained seroconversion up to 9 months PSO, and serum antibody concentrations persistently surpassed adult levels (ratio serum IgG spike children vs. adults 90 days PSO 1.75, P < 0.001; 180 days 1.38, P = 0.01; 270 days 1.54, P = 0.001). In a low-incidence setting, SARS-CoV-2 infection and humoral immune response present distinct patterns in children including higher antibody levels, and lower seroprevalence in families with pediatric index cases. Children show long-term SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. These findings are relevant to novel variants with increased disease burden in children, as well as for the planning of age-appropriate vaccination strategies. Copyright © 2022.

9,Natural infection versus hybrid (natural and vaccination) humoral immune response to SARS-COV-2: A comparative paired analysis,,"Background-Aim: There is substantial immunological evidence that vaccination following natural infection increases protection. We compare the humoral immune response developed in initially seropositive individuals (naturally infected) to humoral hybrid immune response (developed after infection and vaccination) in the same population group after one year. Method(s): The study included 197 male individuals who were naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Trimeric spike, nucleocapsid, and ACE2-RBD blocking antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were measured. Nasal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Information on vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and PCR verified infection was retrieved from official databases (Abu Dhabi Health Data Services- SP LLC. (""Malaffi""), including number of vaccine doses received, date of vaccination, and type of the received vaccine. Result(s): All the study population were tested PCR-Negative at the time of sample collection. Our results showed that there was a significant rise in the mean (SD) and median (IQR) titers of trimeric spike, nucleocapsid and ACE2-RBD blocking antibodies in the post-vaccination stage. The mean (+/- SD) and median (IQR) concentration of the anti-S antibody rose by 3.3-fold (+230 % +/- 197 % SD) and 2.8-fold (+185 %, 220-390 %, p < 0.001), respectively. There was an observed positive dose-response relationship between number of the received vaccine doses and having higher proportion of study participants with higher than median concentration in the difference between the measured anti-S and ACE2-RBD blocking antibodies in the post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination post natural infection elicits a robust immunological response with an impressive rise of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially the ACE2-RBD blocking antibodies.Copyright © 2024",Abdelwareth L.; Alhousani F.; Abuyadek R.; Donnelly J.; Leinberger-Jabari A.; Atef S.; Al-Rifai R.H.,,0009-8981,/10.1016/j.cca.2024.119211,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.cca.2024.119211,1,0,,18
56,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response in a Longitudinal Cohort of Healthcare Workers from India,,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected healthcare systems worldwide. Healthcare Workers (HCWs) form one of the most at-risk population groups for acquiring infection. Trend analysis of anti Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titres in vaccination naive HCWs will give an insight into the role of natural protective immunity against re-infection. Aim(s): To understand the dynamics of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and its protective role against re-infection in a cohort of HCWs. Material(s) and Method(s): This observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Gurugram, North India from June to December 2020. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Serum specimens from 230 HCWs were tested for anti-spike protein Immunogloublin G (IgG) antibodies by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The HCWs with positive antibody status and previous Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed infection (n=47) were followed-up over 180 days for serial antibody titres at four visits, each at a gap of 30-45 days. Participants were classified into asymptomatic (n=18), mild (n=17) and moderate (n=12) disease categories based on severity of previous COVID-19 illness. SPSS version 22.0 was used for statistical analysis. Intergroup comparison of means was done using Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Positivity rate for anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 25.7%. Seroconversion rate was 90.74% in HCWs with history of previous Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection. Incidence of infection in seronegative group (n=171) was 12.96 per 10,000 person days while in seropositive group, it was 1.29 per 10,000 person days. Risk ratio for infection (baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive) was determined to be 8.12 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.068-61.755]. Incidence of PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was inversely associated with antibody titres (p=0.018). Antibody response trend showed a peak in mean titres in the 46-90 days period followed by steep decline till 135 days and a gradual waning till 180 days. Conclusion(s): Significant postinfection immunity is offered by even low to moderate amounts of antibodies and this occurs regardless of whether a seropositive HCW had previous asymptomatic or symptomatic infection. These findings have significant implications in establishing the protective role of anti-spike protein antibodies against subsequent infection.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

49,COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among healthcare workers in Albania (COVE-AL): Protocol for a prospective cohort study and cohort baseline data,,"Introduction Critical questions remain about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in real-world settings, particularly in middle-income countries. We describe a study protocol to evaluate COVID-19 VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers (HWs) in Albania, an upper-middle-income country. Methods and analysis In this 12-month prospective cohort study, we enrolled HWs at three hospitals in Albania. HWs are vaccinated through the routine COVID-19 vaccine campaign. Participants completed a baseline survey about demographics, clinical comorbidities, and infection risk behaviours. Baseline serology samples were also collected and tested against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and respiratory swabs were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Participants complete weekly symptom questionnaires and symptomatic participants have a respiratory swab collected, which is tested for SARS-CoV-2. At 3, 6, 9 months and 12 months of the study, serology will be collected and tested for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. VE will be estimated using a piecewise proportional hazards model (VE=1-HR). Baseline data From February to May 2021, 1504 HWs were enrolled. The median age was 44 (range: 22-71) and 78% were female. At enrolment, 72% of participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 56% of participants were vaccinated with one dose, of whom 98% received their first shot within 4 days of enrolment. All HWs received the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were reviewed and approved by the WHO Ethical Review Board, reference number CERC.0097A, and the Albanian Institute of Public Health Ethical Review Board, reference number 156. All participants have provided written informed consent to participate in this study. The primary results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal at the time of completion.

45,Low rate of SARS-CoV-2 incident infection identified by weekly screening PCR in a prospective year-long cohort study,,"Background Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute to ongoing community transmission, however, the benefit of routine screening of asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations is unclear. Methods To identify SARS-CoV-2 infections 553 seronegative individuals were prospectively followed for 52 weeks. From 4/2020-7/2021, participants submitted weekly self-collected nasal swabs for rtPCR and completed symptom and exposure surveys. Results Incident SARS2-CoV-2 infections were identified in 9/553 (1.6%) participants. Comparisons of SARS2-CoV-2(+) to SARS2-CoV-2(-) participants revealed significantly more close contacts outside the household (median: 5 versus 3; p = 0.005). The incidence of infection was higher among unvaccinated/partially vaccinated than among fully vaccinated participants (9/7,679 versus 0/6,845 person-weeks; p = 0.004). At notification of positive test result, eight cases were symptomatic and one pre-symptomatic. Conclusions These data suggest that weekly SARS2-CoV2 surveillance by rtPCR did not efficiently detect pre-symptomatic infections in unvaccinated participants.Copyright © 2022 Harrington et al.

70,Impact of baseline SARS-CoV-2 antibody status on syndromic surveillance and the risk of subsequent COVID-19-a prospective multicenter cohort study,,"Background: In a prospective healthcare worker (HCW) cohort, we assessed the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to baseline serostatus. Method(s): Baseline serologies were performed among HCW from 23 Swiss healthcare institutions between June and September 2020, before the second COVID-19 wave. Participants answered weekly electronic questionnaires covering information about nasopharyngeal swabs (PCR/rapid antigen tests) and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Screening of symptomatic staff by nasopharyngeal swabs was routinely performed in participating facilities. We compared numbers of positive nasopharyngeal tests and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms between HCW with and without anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. Result(s): A total of 4812 HCW participated, wherein 144 (3%) were seropositive at baseline. We analyzed 107,807 questionnaires with a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Median number of answered questionnaires was similar (24 vs. 23 per person, P = 0.83) between those with and without positive baseline serology. Among 2712 HCW with >= 1 SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up, 3/67 (4.5%) seropositive individuals reported a positive result (one of whom asymptomatic), compared to 547/2645 (20.7%) seronegative participants, 12 of whom asymptomatic (risk ratio [RR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.66). Seropositive HCWs less frequently reported impaired olfaction/taste (6/144, 4.2% vs. 588/4674, 12.6%, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.73), chills (19/144, 13.2% vs. 1040/4674, 22.3%, RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.90), and limb/muscle pain (28/144, 19.4% vs. 1335/4674, 28.6%, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.49-0.95). Impaired olfaction/taste and limb/muscle pain also discriminated best between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Conclusion(s): Having SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies provides almost 80% protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection for a period of at least 8 months.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Kohler P.; Gusewell S.; Seneghini M.; Egger T.; Leal O.; Brucher A.; Lemmenmeier E.; Moller J.C.; Rieder P.; Ruetti M.; Stocker R.; Vuichard-Gysin D.; Wiggli B.; Besold U.; Kuster S.P.; McGeer A.; Risch L.; Friedl A.; Schlegel M.; Vernazza P.; Kahlert C.R.,,1741-7015 (electronic),/10.1186/s12916-021-02144-9,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1186%2fs12916-021-02144-9,1,0,,27
15,A prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced seroconversion and disease incidence in German healthcare workers before and during the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines,,"We assessed the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) before and during the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, in a prospective observational cohort study on healthcare workers (HCWs) in a large tertiary hospital in Mainz, Germany. Antibody status was assessed during six visits between September 2020 and February 2022. Self-reported symptoms were collected using a smartphone application; symptomatic HCWs were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2. Rates of virologically confirmed and severe COVID-19 were estimated using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) case definitions, respectively, and were contrasted to background community transmission and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. A total of 3665 HCWs were enrolled (mean follow-up time: 18 months); 97 met the FDA definition of virologically confirmed COVID-19 (incidence rate (IR) 2.3/1000 person-months (PMs), one severe case). Most cases reported >=2 symptoms, commonly, cough and anosmia or ageusia. Overall, 263 individuals seroconverted (IR 6.6/1000 PMs-2.9 times the estimated IR of COVID-19), indicating many cases were missed, either due to asymptomatic infections or to an atypical presentation of symptoms. A triphasic trend in anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroconversion was observed, with an initial increase following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, a two-fold decline six months later, and finally a six-fold increase by the end of the study when Omicron was the dominant circulating variant. Despite the increase in infection rates at the end of the study due to the circulation of the Omicron variant, the infection and disease rates observed were lower than the published estimates in HCWs and rates in the general local population. Preferential vaccination of HCWs and the strict monitoring program for SARS-CoV-2 infection are the most likely reasons for the successful control of COVID-19 in this high-risk population.Copyright: © 2024 Gehring et al.

69,COVID-19 seroprevalance in a university hospital health workers,,"Introduction: Healthcare workers are at the forefront in the Pandemic war against COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). In this struggle, they have become high-risk by keeping in close contact with patients during their diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up with long working hours. The aim of this study was to contribute to epidemiological data of our country by examining the antibody status of our hospital healthcare workers. Material(s) and Method(s): Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM, COVID-19 ELISA kits were studied from sera samples of healthcare workers in Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty Hospital between June 1 and November 30, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swab samples of these persons were also tested with the Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 741 healthcare workers included in our study was found to be 17%. Seropositivity was detected in 6.4% (33/515) of the healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and in 3.9% (5/130) of the healthcare workers who did not have PCR test. Among the healthcare workers, the highest seroprevalence was observed in nurses (39.6%) followed by doctors (%23). Conclusion(s): It was evaluated that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers is higher than in the population. This study shows that occupational exposure is a risk factor. 3.9% seropositivity was found in healthcare workers who never had a test. Considering that these workers have an asymptomatic or subclinical infection, there is a possible risk for nosocomial transmission. Therefore, healthcare professionals should use personal protective equipment and apply hygiene rules correctly and effectively in infectious diseases, especially during pandemic periods, while working in the hospital.Copyright © Telif Hakki 2021 Flora.

0,Change in the kinetics of sulphacetamide tissue distribution in Walker tumor-bearing rats.,1975,"The effect of Walker tumor on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg. After oral administration of sulphacetamide (5 and 20 min), the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumor-bearing rats when compared with that of control group. However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals. It is concluded that, in Walker tumor-bearing rats, there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug.","Nadeau, D; Marchand, C",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,0090-9556,,1234,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1234,0,1,,30

Her vitals are Temp 96.2 F, BP 123/89, RR 18, spo2 99% on air. On physical examination, her nasal turbinates were pale bilaterally, with no throat congestion. She denies any cough, congestion, fever, muscle aches, shortness of breath, sore throat, loss of taste, or smell sensation. On Investigation: Early march IgG antibody positive for covid-19 and in late May, she was tested positive for RT-PCR covid-19 without symptoms both times. On both occasions, she was working with healthcare workers without strict preventive protocols, who came negative for tests. Her family and close contacts tested negative for COVID-19. Diagnosis: Asymptomatic covid 19 carriers. Treatment: Close monitoring for symptoms. Discussion(s): Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant concern worldwide due to its rapid spread. There are few notable symptomatic cases that are hospitalized and two months after discharge, they still tested positive on the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. It means they are a dormant carrier for COVID-19. But, in our case, the patient was asymptomatic and positive for COVID-19 antibody and RT-PCR test. Surprisingly, all healthcare workers in the clinic came negative on repeated testing.

24,Immune Status and SARS-CoV-2 Viral Dynamics,,"Immunocompromised individuals are disproportionately affected by severe coronavirus disease 2019, but immune compromise is heterogenous, and viral dynamics may vary by the degree of immunosuppression. In this study, we categorized ACTIV-2/A5401 participants based on the extent of immunocompromise into none, mild, moderate, and severe immunocompromise.

44,"Neutralizing COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Blinded, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial",,"Background: Convalescent plasma has been one of the most common treatments for COVID-19, but most clinical trial data to date have not supported its efficacy. Research Question: Is rigorously selected COVID-19 convalescent plasma with neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial among adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory symptoms for < 14 days. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive one unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (n = 487) or placebo (n = 473). The primary outcome was clinical status (disease severity) 14 days following study infusion measured with a seven-category ordinal scale ranging from discharged from the hospital with resumption of normal activities (lowest score) to death (highest score). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable ordinal regression model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) < 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with convalescent plasma than with placebo. In secondary analyses, trial participants were stratified according to the presence of endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (""serostatus"") at randomization. The trial included 13 secondary efficacy outcomes, including 28-day mortality. Result(s): Among 974 randomized patients, 960 were included in the primary analysis. Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not differ between the convalescent plasma and placebo groups in the overall population (aOR, 1.04; one-seventh support interval [1/7 SI], 0.82-1.33), in patients without endogenous antibodies (aOR, 1.15; 1/7 SI, 0.74-1.80), or in patients with endogenous antibodies (aOR, 0.96; 1/7 SI, 0.72-1.30). None of the 13 secondary efficacy outcomes were different between groups. At 28 days, 89 of 482 (18.5%) patients in the convalescent plasma group and 80 of 465 (17.2%) patients in the placebo group had died (aOR, 1.04; 1/7 SI, 0.69-1.58). Interpretation(s): Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, including those seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, treatment with convalescent plasma did not improve clinical outcomes.

94,Systematic screening of kidney transplant patients points towards deficits in neutralizing antibody capacity against sars-cov-2,,"Purpose: The majority of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) is able to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs). Little is known about the virus neutralizing capacity of these Abs. Method(s): KTR were systematically screened for SARS-CoV-2 at the Antwerp University Hospital by nasopharyngeal swab and serum sampling for the detection of respectively SARS-CoV-2 RNA and SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abs using an in-house Luminex assay. Results of Abs against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and Receptor- Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein were expressed as Median Fluorescence Intensities (MFI). Virus neutralisation assays were performed on serum samples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 Abs or a positive RT-PCR test and on samples of an age and sex matched control group of 23 COVID-19 positive immunocompetent patients. Result(s): 135 KTR were included; 13 were known to be RT-PCR positive. Of these 13, 10 (77%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 Abs. Antibody screening revealed two (2%) additional KTR with detectable Abs. Virus neutralizing capacity was observed in 11/12 (92%) antibody positive KTR vs. 22/23 (96%) immunocompetent antibody positive controls (p = 0.63). In patients who showed virus neutralizing capacity (expressed as sample dilution reducing the number of infected wells by 50% (NT50)), significantly higher neutralizing antibody capacity was observed in immunocompetent controls vs. KTR (median NT50 1027 (IQR 395-1601) vs. 217 (IQR 108-534); p=0.01). There was no difference in IgG-NP MFI and IgG-RBD MFI values between both groups (median IgG NP MFI 24554 (IQR 11218-27017) vs. 11387 (IQR 3062-24825); p = 0.13); median IgG RBD MFI 20302 (IQR 13464- 24251) vs. 21736 (6288-24993); p = 0.85). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that KTR have lower neutralizing antibody capacity compared to immunocompetent subjects. The latter might be of high importance for future COVID-19 vaccine trials.",Wijtvliet V.; Arien K.K.; Marien J.; Peeters B.; Hellemans R.; Massart A.; Van Hees S.; Moons P.; Theeten H.; Van Damme P.; Goossens H.; De Winter B.Y.; Ledeganck K.J.; Abramowicz D.,,1600-6143,/10.1111/ajt.16847,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fajt.16847,0,0,,37
34,IMMUNE STATUS AND SARS-CoV-2 VIRAL DYNAMICS,,"Background: Immunocompromised persons are disproportionately affected by severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, but immune compromise is heterogenous, which may impact viral dynamics. We hypothesized that higher degrees of compromised immunity are associated with higher viral shedding and slower viral clearance in the absence of COVID-19 therapeutics. Method(s): Participants enrolled in ACTIV-2/A5401, a platform trial for COVID-19 therapeutics in non-hospitalized adults within 10 days of symptom onset, received either an active treatment or placebo between 8/2020 and 7/2021. Participants were categorized based on the extent of immunosuppression into none, mild, moderate and severe categories at enrollment (day 0). Longitudinal anterior nasal (AN) and plasma SARS-CoV-2 levels were measured with a quantitative PCR assay. Regression models assessed associations between immunocompromise severity and viral levels (VL) at day 0, and longitudinally among those on placebo with quantifiable RNA at day 0. Multivariate analyses adjusted for demographics and symptom duration and vaccination status at day 0. Result(s): Immunocompromised (mild 383, moderate 159, severe 35) and immunocompetent (1956) participants had comparable symptom durations at day 0 (median 6 days) and most were unvaccinated (~95%). AN VL at day 0 was higher in the moderate/severe group compared to the immunocompetent group (adjusted difference in means: 0.47 log10 copies/mL, 95% CI 0.12, 0.83). While AN VL decayed at similar rates among all groups from day 0 to 3, there was a trend towards higher cumulative AN VLs across the 28-day follow-up in the moderate/severe group compared to immunocompetent group (adjusted fold difference in VL AUC 1.63, 95%CI 0.95, 2.77). The mild group showed no differences in day 0 VL or AUC compared to the immunocompetent group. The frequency of detectable plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was similar at day 0 across all groups (overall 21%), but there appeared to be a higher proportion of immunocompromised participants with detectable plasma viral RNA at day 7 (moderate/severe 2/23 [9%], mild 5/44 [11%]) compared to the immunocompetent group (8/282, 3%). Conclusion(s): Before emergence of Omicron and widespread vaccination, moderate/severe immunocompromised status was associated with higher nasal viral levels at study enrollment and showed a trend towards higher cumulative AN viral load, and all immunocompromised groups appeared to have more persistent plasma viremia during follow-up.",Li Y.; Moser C.; Aga E.; Currier J.S.; Wohl D.A.; Daar E.S.; Ritz J.; Coombs R.; Hughes M.D.; Eron J.J.; Smith D.M.; Chew K.W.; Li J.Z.,,2161-5853,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641190589,0,0,,38
12,Cycle threshold dynamics of non-severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory viruses,,"Objective: Many providers use severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cycle thresholds (Ct values) as approximate measures of viral burden in association with other clinical data to inform decisions about treatment and isolation. We characterized temporal changes in Ct values for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses as a first step to determine whether cycle thresholds could play a similar role in the management of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. Design(s): Retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston. Method(s): We retrospectively identified all adult patients with positive nasopharyngeal PCRs for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, or adenovirus between January 2022 and March 2023. We plotted Ct distributions relative to days since symptom onset, and we assessed whether distributions varied by immunosuppression and other comorbidities. Result(s): We analyzed 1,863 positive samples: 506 influenza, 502 rhinovirus, 430 RSV, 219 HMPV, 180 parainfluenza, 26 adenovirus. Ct values were generally 25-30 on the day of symptom onset, lower over the ensuing 1-3 days, and progressively higher thereafter with Ct values >=30 after 1 week for most viruses. Ct values were generally higher and more stable over time for rhinovirus. There was no association between immunocompromised status and median intervals from symptom onset until Ct values were >=30. Conclusion(s): Ct values relative to symptom onset for influenza, RSV, and other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses generally mirror patterns seen with SARS-CoV-2. Further data on associations between Ct values and viral viability, transmissibility, host characteristics, and response to treatment for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses are needed to determine how clinicians and infection preventionists might integrate Ct values into treatment and isolation decisions.Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

85,Antibody response using six different serological assays in a completely PCR-tested community after a coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak-the CoNAN study,,"Objectives: Due to a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses, many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed to determine and characterize the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG-detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: (a) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic versus asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 courses, and (b) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence. Method(s): CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany, which was quarantined from 22 March to 5 April after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the village's population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak comprised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from 13 May to 22 May 2020, 6 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Result(s): We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody-positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: median 2.9 versus 7.2 IgG-index, p 0.002; DS-assay: median 45.2 versus 143 AU/mL, p 0.002). Persisting viral replication was not detected. Conclusion(s): Our data question the relevance and reliability of IgG antibody testing to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infections 6 weeks after an outbreak. We conclude that assessing immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection should not rely on antibody tests alone.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Weis S.; Scherag A.; Baier M.; Kiehntopf M.; Kamradt T.; Kolanos S.; Ankert J.; Glockner S.; Makarewicz O.; Hagel S.; Bahrs C.; Kimmig A.; Proquitte H.; Guerra J.; Rimek D.; Loffler B.; Pletz M.W.; Hotz T.; Local Cooperation Partners; Enders P.; Koch R.; Mai S.; Ullrich M.; Richert C.; Eibner C.; Meinung B.; Stotzer K.; Kohler J.; Cipowicz H.; Pinkwart C.; Bauer M.; Dickmann P.; Licht A.; Scholz J.; Wetzker W.; Hartung A.; Weiss D.; Thieme L.; Hanf G.; Schnizer C.; Muller J.; Kosenkow J.; Rostel F.; Andreas N.; Marquardt R.; Deinhardt-Emmer S.; Kuhn S.,,1198-743X,/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.11.009,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.cmi.2020.11.009,0,0,,40

32,The use of representative community samples to assess SARS-CoV-2 lineage competition: Alpha outcompetes Beta and wild-type in England from January to March 2021,,"Genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 lineages informs our understanding of possible future changes in transmissibility and vaccine efficacy and will be a high priority for public health for the foreseeable future. However, small changes in the frequency of one lineage over another are often difficult to interpret because surveillance samples are obtained using a variety of methods all of which are known to contain biases. As a case study, using an approach which is largely free of biases, we here describe lineage dynamics and phylogenetic relationships of the Alpha and Beta variant in England during the first 3 months of 2021 using sequences obtained from a random community sample who provided a throat and nose swab for rt-PCR as part of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Overall, diversity decreased during the first quarter of 2021, with the Alpha variant (first identified in Kent) becoming predominant, driven by a reproduction number 0.3 higher than for the prior wild-type. During January, positive samples were more likely to be Alpha in those aged 18 to 54 years old. Although individuals infected with the Alpha variant were no more likely to report one or more classic COVID-19 symptoms compared to those infected with wild-type, they were more likely to be antibody-positive 6 weeks after infection. Further, viral load was higher in those infected with the Alpha variant as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) values. The presence of infections with non-imported Beta variant (first identified in South Africa) during January, but not during February or March, suggests initial establishment in the community followed by fade-out. However, this occurred during a period of stringent social distancing.

19,A SEROPOSITIVE SARS-COV-2 CONTROLLED HUMAN INFECTION MODEL DEMONSTRATING POTENT PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY AND IDENTIFICATION OF IMMUNE CORRELATES OF PROTECTION,,"Introduction Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) involve the deliberate exposure of individuals to a pathogen in a controlled environment. Respiratory organism CHIMs have been utilised to further understanding on the kinetics of infection or host-pathogen immunobiology plus enabling expedited testing of vaccines and therapeutics. A SARS-CoV-2 CHIM has been undertaken in seronegative volunteers utilising a dose of 10TCID50 pre-Alpha virus strain. Sustained infection was seen in 53% (18/34) volunteers with infectious virus persisting for on average 10 days.1 Development of a seropositive model is necessary to allow full assessment of immune correlates of protection (CoP) and enable use for vaccine and therapeutic development given the increasing global seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2. Methods 36 healthy, SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, 18-30-year-old volunteers were inoculated intranasally with increasing doses of pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2 virus (same as used in the seronegative CHIM) in a sequential fashion up to a dose of 105 TCID50. Volunteers were quarantined for at least 14 days after inoculation and until 12-hourly oropharyngeal/nasal swabs were negative for viable virus. The primary objective being identification of a safe, well-tolerated dose that induced infection in 50% of volunteers. Results Only five of 36 (13.9%) volunteers developed infection despite dose escalation up to 105TCID50. Infection kinetics differed compared to the seronegative CHIM, with volunteers demonstrating transient episodes of PCR positivity only (median duration 12 hours). Comparison of pre-inoculation samples identified significantly lower baseline mucosal and systemic SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titres and lower peripheral IFN-y responses against a CD8+ T cell SARS-CoV- 2 peptide pool in infected volunteers. Conclusions Our inability to reproduce the sustained infection kinetic seen in the seronegative CHIM despite a significant dose escalation using the same viral strain demonstrates the potent protective immunity induced by homologous vaccination and homologous/heterologous prior SARS CoV-2 infection. Our model has identified credible CoP against infection with work ongoing to interrogate post exposure immunity. Model development to induce sufficient infection rates for product evaluation and further validation of our identified CoP is required.",Jackson S.; Marshall J.L.; Mawer A.; Lopez Ramon R.; Harris S.A.; Satti I.; Hughes E.; Preston-Jones H.; Cabrera Puig I.; Longet S.; Tipton T.; Laidlaw S.; Powell Doherty R.; Morrison H.; Mitchell R.; Ateere A.; Stylianou E.; Wu M.S.; Fredsgaard-Jones T.P.W.; Tanner R.; Rapeport G.; Carroll M.; Catchpole A.; Chiu C.; McShane H.,,1468-3296,/10.1136/thorax-2023-BTSabstracts.115,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1136%2fthorax-2023-BTSabstracts.115,0,0,,47
116,Genetic Evidence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-Cov) and Widespread Seroprevalence among Camels in Kenya,,"We describe the first genome isolation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Kenya. This fatal zoonotic pathogen was first described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79.50-84.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28%, 95% CI 71.14-77.19) than male camels (P < 0.001) (53.74%, 95% CI 48.48-58.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses. None of the human plasma screened contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. This study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels. Further one-health surveillance approaches in camels, wildlife, and human populations are needed.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).",Ommeh S.; Zhang W.; Zohaib A.; Chen J.; Zhang H.; Hu B.; Ge X.-Y.; Yang X.-L.; Masika M.; Obanda V.; Luo Y.; Li S.; Waruhiu C.; Li B.; Zhu Y.; Ouma D.; Odendo V.; Wang L.-F.; Anderson D.E.; Lichoti J.; Mungube E.; Gakuya F.; Zhou P.; Ngeiywa K.-J.; Yan B.; Agwanda B.; Shi Z.-L.,,1674-0769,/10.1007/s12250-018-0076-4,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1007%2fs12250-018-0076-4,0,0,,48

104,Casirivimab with imdevimab antibody cocktail for COVID-19 prevention: Interim results,,"Background: Passive immunization has a long history for infection prevention following exposure. We report results of a descriptive interim analysis from a study of an antibody ""cocktail"" of casirivimab with imdevimab (cas/imdev; formerly REGN-COV2) designed to bind non-competing epitopes of the viral spike protein, as a potential passive vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in people at risk of infection from household contact. Method(s): In this ongoing Phase 3 study, asymptomatic participants exposed to a COVID-19-infected household member were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 1200 mg cas/imdev (600 mg of each antibody administered subcutaneously) within 96 hours of their household member testing positive. The analysis included participants who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasal, saliva, or nasopharyngeal swab and who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. The proportion of participants who developed an RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic) during the 1-month efficacy assessment period was summarized. Result(s): Initial results from the first evaluable 223 placebo and 186 cas/imdev participants who completed >=29 days of the study are reported. Reduction in PCR-positive symptomatic disease was 100% (0/186 cas/imdev vs 8/223 placebo; OR 0.00 [CI 0.00, 0.69]). Reduction in any PCR-positive infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) was 48% (10/186 vs 23/223; OR 0.49 [CI 0.20, 1.12]). Placebo-group participants had on average 100-fold higher peak viral load. In the cas/imdev group, viral RNA was not detected for longer than 1 week but was detected for 3-4 weeks in approximately 40% of placebo participants (Fig. 1). The proportions of infected participants with high viral loads (>10 4 copies/mL) were 13/21 placebo vs 0/9 cas/imdev. Total weeks of viral RNA detection and high viral load were 44 and 22 weeks in the placebo group vs 9 and 0 in the cas/imdev group. Total symptomatic weeks were 21 for placebo vs 0 for cas/imdev. A similar proportion of participants experienced at least 1 serious adverse event: placebo, 3/222 and cas/imdev, 1/186; none were deemed related to study treatment. Injection site reactions were similar: placebo, 1.4%; cas/ imdev, 2.6%. Conclusion(s): In this descriptive interim analysis of participants at risk of SARSCoV- 2 infection from household transmission, a subcutaneous dose of the cas/ imdev antibody cocktail prevented symptomatic infection, reduced overall infection, and decreased viral load and duration of viral RNA detection.",O'Brien M.P.; Neto E.F.; Chen K.-C.; Isa F.; Heirman I.; Sarkar N.; Ramesh D.; Cohen M.S.; Barnabas R.; Hurt C.B.; Barouch D.H.; Bar K.J.; Herman G.; Yancopoulos G.D.; Weinreich D.M.,,2161-5853,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&AN=635068315,0,0,,50
7,Think atypical!,,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in school-age children and adults, which showed a delayed re-emergence after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in late 2023. In general, Mp-CAP is mild and self-limiting, but severe forms have been reported in both immunocompetent and -compromised patients. A 7-year-old boy with an unspecified inflammatory bowel disease, linked to a heterozygous TRAF3 deletion mutation and under Sirolimus treatment since 2022, was referred to our hospital due to diminished general conditions, accompanied by high fever, tachypnea, and a two-week history of cough. Initially treated with amoxicillin for suspected CAP, the pediatrician switched to clarithromycin 48 hours before referral due to persisting fever. A nasopharyngeal swab was tested positive for Mp by PCR. At admission, a chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation and a basal right infiltrate. Initial CRP level was elevated (126 mg/l). The antibiotic treatment was extended to intravenous cefuroxime for suspected conventional bacterial CAP. In the next days, due to a lack of clinical response, the antibiotic treatment was changed to intravenous doxycycline. A chest computed tomography scan showed necrotizing pneumonia with a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe. The patient was transferred to the University Children's Hospital Zurich for in-depth microbiological investigations via bronchoalveolar lavage. Again, exclusively Mp could be detected by PCR, but sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene revealed a A2063G mutation, which confers high-level macrolide resistance. Thereafter, a methylprednisolone treatment for 5 days was added, leading to a rapid resolution of fever and improvement of the child's general conditions. Antibiotic treatment was switched to oral doxycycline and continued for a total of 4 weeks due to necrotizing pneumonia. This case highlights the importance of considering Mp as a possible pathogen causing necrotizing pneumonia, also in Switzerland. Severe courses are associated with macrolide-resistant Mp, irrespective of the patients' immune status. In case of clinical non-response to macrolides, genotypic analysis should be performed. However, immunosuppression, in the reported case by Sirolimus, may contribute to aggravation and haploinsufficiency in TRAF3 may have had an impact, being associated with higher susceptibility to infections, systemic inflammation and autoimmunity.",Thurner A.; Delco-Volonte C.; Zanolari M.; Simonetti G.D.; Prader S.; Pachlopnik Schmid J.; Meyer Sauteur P.M.; Kottanattu L.,,1424-7860,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&AN=644555955,0,0,,51

57,Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Bovine Coronavirus Vaccines in Goats,,"Background: A novel coronavirus, closely related to bovine/bovine-like coronaviruses, was identified in 2017, associated with an outbreak of gastrointestinal disease in goats. A bovine coronavirus ELISA adapted to detect anti-bovine coronavirus antibodies in goats has shown coronavirus is an important pathogen in California goat populations. Objective(s): To determine the safety and immunogenicity of bovine coronavirus vaccines, a modified live intranasal (MLV) and an intramuscular killed (KV) in goats. Animals: Twenty 18-month-old seronegative does randomized into two groups: MLV and KV, 7 vaccinates and 3 placebo controls per group. Method(s): Vaccines were administered per manufacturer's instructions for cattle; a single intranasal dose for the MLV and a 2-dose series for the KV. Serum samples, nasal and rectal swabs, injection site monitoring and physical exams were done regularly. PCR for coronavirus was done on swabs. ELISA was performed on serum, results analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. Result(s): Coronavirus PCR: One positive nasal swab 2 days post vaccination in an MLV vaccinate, all other swabs were PCR negative. ELISA: All KV vaccinates seroconverted, none of the MLV or control animals did. Titers in KV vaccinates were significantly higher than controls at booster (p=0.029), increased following booster, with peak titers occurring 2 weeks post-booster (p<0.0001). No reactions were seen post MLV or first dose KV dose; second KV dose resulted in local reactions in 5/7 goats. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: While seroconversion occurred with the KV, clinical efficacy of both vaccines remains unknown; however, both seem to be safe to use in goats.",Heller M.; Buktenica M.; Smith F.; Busch R.; Laabs M.; Rowe J.,,1939-1676,/10.1111/jvim.16541,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fjvim.16541,0,0,,53
110,Antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein evaluated by four automated immunoassays and three ELISAs,,"Objectives: The aim was to determine the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein using four automated immunoassays and three ELISAs for the detection of total Ig antibodies (Roche) or IgG (Abbott, Diasorin, Snibe, Euroimmun, Mikrogen) in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. Result(s): Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7-100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7-97.8) and 100% (96.1-100). Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% (79.8-89.0) and 81.1% (76.6-85.7), p < 0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the three IgG anti-N assays (Abbott, Mikrogen, Euroimmun) than for the two IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin, Euroimmun) (>=50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12 and p < 0.05 for percent seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. Discussion(s): Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",Van Elslande J.; Decru B.; Jonckheere S.; Van Wijngaerden E.; Houben E.; Vandecandelaere P.; Indevuyst C.; Depypere M.; Desmet S.; Andre E.; Van Ranst M.; Lagrou K.; Vermeersch P.,,1198-743X,/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.038,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1016%2fj.cmi.2020.07.038,0,0,,54
3,Gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with placental expression of immune and trophoblast genes,,"Introduction: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and can have effects on the placenta, even in the absence of severe disease or vertical transmission to the fetus. This study aimed to evaluate histopathologic and molecular effects in the placenta after SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Method(s): We performed a study of 45 pregnant participants from the Generation C prospective cohort study at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We compared histologic features and the expression of 48 immune and trophoblast genes in placentas delivered from 15 SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positive and 30 IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative mothers. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact tests, Spearman correlations and linear regression models. Result(s): The median gestational age at the time of SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology test was 35 weeks. Two of the IgG positive participants also had a positive RT-PCR nasal swab at delivery. 82.2% of the infants were delivered at term (>=37 weeks), and gestational age at delivery did not differ between the SARSCoV-2 antibody positive and negative groups. No significant differences were detected between the groups in placental histopathology features. Differential expression analyses revealed decreased expression of two trophoblast genes (PSG3 and CGB3) and increased expression of three immune genes (CXCL10, TLR3 and DDX58) in placentas delivered from SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive participants. Discussion(s): SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with gene expression changes of immune and trophoblast genes in the placenta at birth which could potentially contribute to long-term health effects in the offspring.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

82,Efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7): an exploratory analysis of a randomised controlled trial,,"Background: A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, emerged as the dominant cause of COVID-19 disease in the UK from November, 2020. We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), against this variant. Method(s): Volunteers (aged >=18 years) who were enrolled in phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK, and who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease (a cough, a fever of 37.8degreeC or higher, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs MenACWY groups) derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. Finding(s): Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13, 2020, and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30, 2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18-55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8.9, 95% CI 7.2-11.0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70.4% (95% CI 43.6-84.5) for B.1.1.7 and 81.5% (67.9-89.4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages. Interpretation(s): ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro, but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

28,"Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK",,"Background: A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials. Method(s): This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5 x 1010 viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674. Finding(s): Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (95% CI 41.0-75.7; 27 [0.6%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs71 [1.6%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90.0% (67.4-97.0; three [0.2%] of 1367 vs 30 [2.2%] of 1374; pinteraction=0.010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70.4% (95.8% CI 54.8-80.6; 30 [0.5%] of 5807 vs 101 [1.7%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3.4 months, IQR 1.3-4.8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation. Interpretation(s): ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.

83,"Assessment of commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, Jamaica",,"Background: The performance of the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM, Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, and Trillium IgG/IgM rapid assays was evaluated in Jamaica. Method(s): Diagnostic sensitivities of the assays were assessed by testing serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed persons and diagnostic specificity was assessed by testing serum samples collected during 2018-2019 from healthy persons and from persons with antibodies to a wide range of viral infections. Result(s): Serum samples collected >=14 days after onset of symptoms, or an initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive test for asymptomatics, showed diagnostic sensitivities ranging from 67.9 to 75.0% when including all possible disease severities and increased to 90.0-95.0% when examining those with moderate to critical disease. Grouping moderate to critical disease showed a significant association with a SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive result for all assays. Diagnostic specificity ranged from 96.7 to 100.0%. For all assays examined, SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of the initial nasopharyngeal swab sample testing positive were significantly different for samples testing antibody positive versus negative. Conclusion(s): These data from a predominantly African descent Caribbean population show comparable diagnostic sensitivities and specificities for all testing platforms assessed and limited utility of these tests for persons with asymptomatic and mild infections.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Butterfield T.R.; Bruce-Mowatt A.; Phillips Y.Z.R.; Brown N.; Francis K.; Brown J.; Walker J.P.; McKnight N.A.L.; Ehikhametalor K.; Taylor D.K.; Bruce C.A.; McGrowder D.; Wharfe G.; Sandiford S.L.; Thompson T.K.; Anzinger J.J.,,1201-9712,/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.059,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.ijid.2021.02.059,0,0,,59
47,Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission upon return to work in RNA-positive healthcare workers,,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and for spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) amongst colleagues and patients. Aim(s): To study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and possible onward transmission by HCWs upon return to work after COVID-19, and association with disease severity and development of antibodies over time. Method(s): Unvaccinated HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were recruited prospectively. Data on symptoms were collected via telephone questionnaires on days 2, 7, 14 and 21 after a positive test. Upon return to work, repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed and serum was collected. Repeat serum samples were collected at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 to determine antibody dynamics over time. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate possible transmission events originating from HCWs with a positive repeat RT-PCR. Finding(s): Sixty-one (84.7%) participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 had a repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed upon return to work (median 13 days after symptom onset), of which 30 (49.1%) were positive with a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 29.2 (IQR 26.9-29.9). All HCWs developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences in symptomatology and presence of antibodies were found between repeat RT-PCR-positive and -negative HCWs. Eleven direct colleagues of six participants with a repeat RT-PCR Ct value <30 tested positive after the HCW returned to work. Phylogenetic and epidemiologic analysis did not indicate onward transmission through HCWs who were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive upon return to work. Conclusion(s): HCWs regularly return to work with substantial SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads. However, this study found no evidence for subsequent in-hospital transmission.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)",Kolodziej L.M.; Hordijk S.; Koopsen J.; Maas J.J.; Thung H.T.; Spijkerman I.J.B.; Jonges M.; Bomers M.K.; Sikkens J.J.; de Jong M.D.; Zonneveld R.; Schinkel J.,,0195-6701,/10.1016/j.jhin.2022.02.024,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.jhin.2022.02.024,0,0,,60
90,ANTI-SARS-COV-2 antibodies in new-onset type 1 diabetes in children during pandemic in Belgium,,"Introduction: A pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is developing worldwide and questions are emerging concerning the long-term consequences, as a possible increase in type 1 diabetes. Objective(s): To describe the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Belgian children developing type 1 diabetes during the pandemic. Method(s): Inclusion criteria were all patients admitted with new-onset type 1 diabetes to our Diabetes Clinic between March 2020 and February 2021. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a nasopharyngeal swab at admission. SARS-CoV-2 serology was taken within the first month of diabetes and total antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) were measured. A second sample was taken 3 to 12 weeks after the first sampling. Result(s): Between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021, 86 patients were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Of the 75 who accepted to participate, only one was SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive. We found positivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 20% patients. Participants with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had an increased bicarbonate and base excess compared to participants without anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Overall 29% patients presented DKA at diagnosis and 2 (9%) of whom were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 75 participants, 72% were IA2A positive but IA2A positivity had significantly higher frequencies in children without anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Nine patients, initially seronegative, have developed anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between the two samples (mean time 8 +/- 4 weeks). Conclusion(s): This study showed a prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes similar to that found in children without diabetes in a country severely affected by this pandemic. Longer-term follow-up is needed to define a possible link between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the development of autoimmune diabetes in children.",Messaaoui A.; Hajselova L.; Tenoutasse S.,,1399-5448,/10.1111/pedi.13268,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fpedi.13268,0,0,,61
155,Detection of respiratory and enteric shedding of bovine coronaviruses in cattle in an Ohio feedlot.,2002 Jul,"Recently, bovine coronavirus (BCV) has been isolated from new cattle arrivals to feedlots, but the association between respiratory and enteric infections with BCV in feedlot cattle remains uncertain. Fecal and nasal swab samples from 85 Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) feedlot cattle averaging 7 months of age were collected at arrival (0) and at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days postarrival (DPA). An antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concurrent shedding of BCV in fecal and nasal samples. All samples ELISA positive for BCV were matched with an equal number of BCV ELISA-negative samples and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the N gene. Paired sera were collected at arrival and 21 DPA and tested for antibodies to BCV using an indirect ELISA. Information on clinical signs, treatments provided, and cattle weights were collected. The overall rates of BCV nasal and fecal shedding were 48% (41/85) and 53% (45/85) by ELISA and 84% (71/85) and 96% (82/85) by RT-PCR, respectively. The peak of BCV nasal and fecal shedding occurred at 4 DPA. Thirty-two cattle (38%) showed concurrent enteric and nasal shedding detected by both tests. Eleven percent of cattle had antibody titers against BCV at 0 DPA and 91% of cattle seroconverted to BCV by 21 DPA. The BCV fecal and nasal shedding detected by ELISA and RT-PCR were statistically correlated with ELISA antibody seroconversion (P < 0.0001); however, BCV fecal and nasal shedding were not significantly related to clinical signs. Seroconversion to BCV was inversely related to average daily weight gains (P < 0.06). Twenty-eight respiratory and 7 enteric BCV strains were isolated from nasal and fetal samples of 32 cattle in HRT-18 cell cultures. These findings confirm the presence of enteric and respiratory BCV infections in feedlot calves.

10,480. Duration of Infectious Virus Shedding by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant among Immunocompromised Patients,,"Background. Immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA longer than usual, but the duration of viral shedding and criteria for nosocomial de-isolation in these patients remains unclear. Methods. A prospective cohort study was performed at two tertiary medical centers in Japan during the Omicron epidemic waves from July 8, 2022, to January 30, 2023. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were serially collected from immunocompromised COVID-19 patients. We included populations with either hematological malignancies, solid tumors, autoimmune diseases, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Patients were classified as severely or moderately immunocompromised based on the national COVID-19 guidelines in Japan. The relationship among patients' characteristics, immune status, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and duration of infectious virus shedding between the two groups was assessed using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests. Results. Among 41 patients with 163 samples, nine patients and 47 samples were severely immunocompromised, and 32 patients and 116 samples were moderately immunocompromised. The median ages of the two groups were 70 (IQR: 56-71) and 70.5 (IQR: 60.75-75) years, respectively. In the severely immunocompromised group, 87.2% of the samples (41/47) were PCR-positive, with a median Cq value of 26.1 (IQR: 20.5-30.2), and 36.2% (17/47) were culture-positive. In the moderately immunocompromised group, 75.0% of the samples (87/116) were PCR-positive, with a median Cq value of 21.9 (IQR: 18.4-28.6), and 38.8% (45/116) were culture-positive (Table 1). Of the 62 culture-positive samples, five (8.1%) were culture-positive from day 20 onwards, all from severely immunocompromised patients (P = 0.001). In moderately immunocompromised patients, none were culture-positive on day 12 or later (Figure 1). Conclusion. In COVID-19 patients, particularly those severely immunocompromised, the duration of viral shedding should be closely monitored. Further research is needed to establish a safe period for in-hospital de-isolation of immunocompromised patients.",Kamegai K.; Iwamoto N.; Itoh N.; Ishikane M.; Asai Y.; Akazawa N.; Fuwa N.; Takasaki J.; Hojo M.; Hangaishi A.; Togano T.; Teruya K.; Kanno T.; Takahashi K.; Miyamoto S.; Hirata Y.; Saito T.; Katano H.; Suzuki T.; Ohmagari N.,,2328-8957,/10.1093/ofid/ofad500.550,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fofid%2fofad500.550,0,0,,64
55,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic reinfection in four healthcare professionals from the same hospital despite the presence of antibodies,,"Objectives: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, raising additional public health concerns. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was assessed in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Tunisia because they are at the greatest exposure to infection by different variants. Method(s): We conducted whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA from clinical specimens collected during the initial infection and the suspected reinfection from 4 HCWs, who were working at the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia) and retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after recovery from a first infection. A total of 8 viral RNAs from the patients' respiratory specimens were obtained, which allowed us to characterize the differences between viral genomes from initial infection and positive retest. The serology status for total Ig, IgG, and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was also determined and followed after the first infection. Result(s): We confirmed through whole-genome sequencing of the viral samples that all 4 cases experienced a reinfection event. The interval between the 2 infection events ranged between 45 and 141 days, and symptoms were milder in the second infection for 2 patients and more severe for the remaining 2 patients. Reinfection occurred in all 4 patients despite the presence of antibodies in 3 of them. Conclusion(s): This study adds to the rapidly growing evidence of COVID-19 reinfection, where viral sequences were used to confirm infection by distinct isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs. These findings suggest that individuals who are exposed to different SARS-CoV-2 variants might not acquire sufficiently protective immunity through natural infection and emphasize the necessity of their vaccination and the regular follow-up of their immune status both in quantitative and qualitative terms.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",Gargouri S.; Souissi A.; Abid N.; Chtourou A.; Feki-Berrajah L.; Karray R.; Kossentini H.; Ben Ayed I.; Abdelmoula F.; Chakroun O.; Nasri A.; Hammami A.; Rekik N.; Masmoudi S.; Karray-Hakim H.; Rebai A.,,1201-9712,/10.1016/j.ijid.2022.01.006,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.ijid.2022.01.006,0,0,,65
63,Immunocompromised Seroprevalence and Course of Illness of SARS-CoV-2 in One Pediatric Quaternary Care Center,,"Background. The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. Methods. This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant (SOT), bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results. We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 0.3%-2.4%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared with other groups. Conclusions. Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3%-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

106,Assessment of Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 in a Cohort of Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients,,"Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective(s): To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Method(s): SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusion(s): Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.© Copyright © 2020 Nailescu, Khalid, Wilson, Amanat, Arregui, Canas, Hooks, Krammer, Schwaderer and Hains.",Nailescu C.; Khalid M.; Wilson A.C.; Amanat F.; Arregui S.; Canas J.; Hooks J.; Krammer F.; Schwaderer A.L.; Hains D.S.,,2296-2360 (electronic),/10.3389/fped.2020.601327,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffped.2020.601327,0,0,,67
26,A comparison of sampling and testing approaches for the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed American mink,,"Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in American mink (Neovison vison) is a global priority because outbreaks on mink farms have potential consequences for animal and public health. Surveillance programs often focus on screening natural mortalities; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding sampling and testing approaches. Using 76 mink from 3 naturally infected farms in British Columbia, Canada, we compared the performance of 2 reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) targets (the envelope [E] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] genes) as well as serology. We also compared RT-rtPCR and sequencing results from nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, skin, and rectal swabs, as well as nasopharyngeal samples collected using swabs and interdental brushes. We found that infected mink were generally RT-rtPCR-positive on all samples; however, Ct values differed significantly among sample types (nasopharyngeal < oropharyngeal < skin < rectal). There was no difference in the results of nasopharyngeal samples collected using swabs or interdental brushes. For most mink (89.4%), qualitative (i.e., positive vs. negative) serology and RT-rtPCR results were concordant. However, mink were positive on RT-rtPCR and negative on serology and vice versa, and there was no significant correlation between Ct values on RT-rtPCR and percent inhibition on serology. Both the E and RdRp targets were detectable in all sample types, albeit with a small difference in Ct values. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in multiple sample types, passive surveillance programs in mink should focus on multiple target RT-rtPCR testing of nasopharyngeal samples in combination with serology.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).",Himsworth C.G.; Caleta J.M.; Coombe M.; McGregor G.; Dibernardo A.; Lindsay R.; Sekirov I.; Prystajecky N.,,1040-6387,/10.1177/10406387231183685,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1177%2f10406387231183685,0,0,,68
17,Seroprevalence and immunological memory against SARS-CoV-2 in lung cancer patients (p): SOLID study,,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is diagnosed by detecting the virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The majority of p go on to develop antibodies (Ab) against viral proteins. However, it is not known how long these antibodies last nor whether cancer treatments could affect the duration of immune response. The prognosis and greater or lesser vulnerability of the oncological population are also unknown. Method(s): This prospective, longitudinal, multicenter serological study in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 was carried out in 50 Spanish hospitals. Eligibility criteria was a diagnosis of any thoracic cancer. The first determinations were performed between April 21, 2020 and June 3, 2020, either for p in follow up or in active treatment. Between September 10, 2020, and November 20, 2020, the second antibody (Ab) determination was performed in all previously seropositive p. Clinical and treatment data were collected, as was their clinical situation at study end. Study objectives were to prospectively determine seroprevalence in unselected lung cancer p during the first wave of the pandemic; the natural history of these p; the persistence of immunity more than 4 months after first determination; protection or lack thereof against reinfection after this period, and the nature of such protection; and the influence of treatments on maintenance or loss of immunity. Result(s): Of 1,500 p studied, 128 were seropositive, representing an overall prevalence of 8.5% seropositivity [95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%, 10.1%]. Seventy-five percent were in active cancer treatment. COVID-19 infection was suspected in 47.7% [95% CI, 38.8%, 56.6%]. A second determination was performed on average 4.5 months later [IQR: 4; 5] and obtained for 104 of the initially seropositive p (81%). A second determination could not be obtained in 24 p, the majority due to death caused by disease progression (73%). In the second determination, IgG was not detected in 30.8% (32/104) of p. The severity of the infection, the need for hospitalization (p: 0.032) and the presence of symptoms at diagnosis (p: 0.02), including fever (p: 0.005) and nasal congestion (p: 0.005), were associated with persistence of immunity in the second determination. No variables or treatments received were associated with Ab loss. At time of last follow-up among those p for whom a second determination was performed, 89% (93 p) had completely recovered from the virus, with no lasting after effects. Only 1 of the 128 (0.78%) seropositive p had died from COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of infection in lung cancer p is similar to that of the general population. Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be compromised by treatment, persisting beyond 4 months. Neither do mortality rates appear to be particularly high in this unselected population.",Provencio M.; Rodriguez-Abreu D.; Lorduy A.C.; Serrano G.M.; Granados A.L.O.; Aguado C.; Vivanco G.L.; Guirado M.; Estival A.; Munarriz B.J.; Arasanz H.; Coves J.; Majem M.; Massuti B.; Vazquez-Estevez S.; Juan-Vidal O.; Lucia C.; Del Barco E.; Cobo M.,,1527-7755,/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.8531,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1200%2fjco.2021.39.15_suppl.8531,0,0,,69

74,Viral Infectivity in Patients Undergoing Tracheotomy With COVID-19: A Preliminary Study,,"Objective: To establish the presence of live virus and its association with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and antibody status in patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheotomy. Study Design: Prospective observational study. Setting(s): Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. Result(s): Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. Conclusion(s): In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded. We do however suggest that a preoperative negative PCR swab not be a prerequisite and that antibody titer levels may serve as a useful adjunct for assessment of infectivity.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",George M.M.; McIntyre C.J.; Zhou J.; Kugathasan R.; Amos D.C.; Dillon I.J.; Barclay W.S.; Tolley N.S.,,0194-5998,/10.1177/01945998211004255,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1177%2f01945998211004255,0,0,,71
60,Microrna Profiles in Saliva of Children with and Without Severe Disease Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 Infection,,"Background: The majority of children with exposure to SARSCoV-2 virus have mild disease. However severe diseases such as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MISC) and pneumonia do occur in children. Currently, there are no established biomarkers that can predict progression to severe disease in children exposed to the virus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that can be found in saliva and are thought to play a role in the regulation of inflammation following an infection. Our objective was to compare the miRNA profile in saliva of children with or without severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): This prospective observational study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RADx Program. Children <= 18 years of age presenting to two tertiary care children's hospitals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by PCR test, serology or epidemiological link) were enrolled between 03/29/2021 and 04/30/2021. Severe infection was defined as any of the following within 30 days of testing: MISC or Kawasaki disease diagnosis, requirement for oxygen > 2L, inotropes, mechanical ventilation or ECMO, or the occurrence of death. Informed consent and a saliva swab were obtained at the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (DNA Genotek, Ottowa Canada), and RNA was extracted (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Small RNA species (<50 base pairs) were interrogated via shotgun sequencing (HiSeq 2500, Illumina, San Diego, CA) and miRNAs were quantified through alignment to the human genome (GRCh38). RNA features with sparse counts (<10 in 90% of samples) were filtered, and the data was quantile normalized and mean-center scaled. Salivary miRNA levels were compared between those with severe and non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using Wilcoxon tests with Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing corrections. In addition, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify miRNA pairs that could best discriminate severe cases based on a Monte Carlo 100-fold cross-validated area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Result(s): Samples from 33 children were analyzed. Median age was 3 (3, 10) years and 54.5% were males. Of the total, 29 were RT PCR positive, 4 had a positive serology and 6 children had severe infection. Seven miRNAs displayed significant differences (Fold change >2, FDR adjusted p < 0.1) among children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table). All seven miRNAs were up-regulated in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. A logistic regression using a single ratio of miR-296-5p/miR-378j yielded 1.0 AUROC for differentiating children with severe infection (Figure). Conclusion(s): In this interim analysis of salivary miRNA in childhood SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a differential expression of 7 salivary miRNAs in children with severe infection. Ongoing work will seek to validate these findings and explore the role of miRNA in predicting severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.

72,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial",,"Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising strategy to break COVID-19 transmission. Although hydroxychloroquine was evaluated for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, it is not evaluated for COVID-19 PrEP yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine against placebo in healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during an epidemic period. Method(s): We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in three hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. From 350 adult healthcare workers screened, we included 269 participants with no active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection (determined by a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and a negative serology against SARS-CoV-2). Participants allocated in the intervention arm (PrEP) received 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily for the first four consecutive days and subsequently, 400 mg weekly during the study period. Participants in the control group followed the same treatment schedule with placebo tablets. Result(s): 52.8% (142/269) of participants were in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 47.2% (127/269) in the placebo arm. Given the national epidemic incidence decay, only one participant in each group was diagnosed with COVID-19. The trial was stopped due to futility and our study design was deemed underpowered to evaluate any benefit regarding PrEP efficacy. Both groups showed a similar proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event (AE) (p=0.548). No serious AEs were reported. Almost all AEs (96.4%, 106/110) were mild. Only mild gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly higher in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the placebo arm (27.4% (39/142) vs 15.7% (20/127), p=0.041). Conclusion(s): Although the efficacy of PrEP with hydroxychloroquine for preventing COVID-19 could not be evaluated, our study showed that PrEP with hydroxychloroquine at low doses is safe.

To determine the cumulative incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated risk factors, we conducted a prospective clinical and serological survey in a cohort of 278 liver transplant recipients (LTRs) from Central Italy. Three different serology tests were performed every 4 months in 259 LTRs between April 2020 and April 2021: one based on raw extract of whole SARS-CoV-2 virus and two on specific viral antigens (nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain) to detect specific IgG, IgM and IgA.

5,PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS-INDUCED ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME WITH BACKGROUND OF VAPING IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT HOST,,"SESSION TITLE: Critical Illness from Infections III SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Case Reports PRESENTED ON: 10/09/2024 12:30 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common virus which most frequently causes mild upper respiratory infections in adults. It has been shown to lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in pediatric and immunocompromised adult patients. The development of ARDS secondary to PIV in an immunocompetent host is rare with only two cases reported (1,2). Herein, we describe a case of a young immunocompetent patient who developed severe ARDS secondary to PIV-4 in the setting of E-cigarette and vaping use. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old male presented for further evaluation of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath of four days duration. The patient's social history was remarkable for chronic alcohol abuse, nicotine-based e-cigarette dependence, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-based vape product abuse. On presentation, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic, and hypoxic with saturations in the low 80's. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities. Comprehensive respiratory panel was positive for PIV-4. His initial ABG demonstrated a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. The patient was placed on steroids and empiric antibiotic therapy. He maintained his saturations by alternating between high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Five days after admission the patient had an acute worsening requiring intubation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was completed after intubation which demonstrated no other cause of ARDS. The patient had refractory hypoxemia requiring paralyzing and proning. Despite these measures, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio remained less than 100 and ECMO was initiated on day 5 of mechanical ventilation and day 10 of hospitalization. The patient received a bilateral lung transplantation 74 days after admission and is doing well. DISCUSSION: This immunocompetent patient developed PIV-4 induced ARDS in the setting of E-cigarette use and vaping cannabis. The effects of vaping and vape-related products have not been fully characterized. There is evidence that vape related products affect the local immune system within the lungs, encouraging a hyper-inflammatory state that causes local damage, impairs surfactant, and causes reduced bacterial and viral clearance (3). This altered immune response could result in E-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) and predispose patients to more severe manifestations of infectious diseases. This patient developed severe, life-threatening ARDS from a virus which usually causes benign manifestations in immunocompetent adults. It is likely the negative immune effects of vaping played a role in the severity of his disease. CONCLUSION(S): This case adds to the evidence that vaping can predispose immunocompetent adults to rare, severe pulmonary complications of common respiratory infections.

1,Global Sensitivity Analysis of the Onset of Nasal Passage Infection by SARS-CoV-2 With Respect to Heterogeneity in Host Physiology and Host Cell-Virus Kinetic Interactions,,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, positive nasal swab tests have revealed dramatic population heterogeneity in viral titers spanning 6 orders-of-magnitude. Our goal here is to probe potential drivers of infection outcome sensitivity arising from (i) physiological heterogeneity between hosts and (ii) host-variant heterogeneity in the detailed kinetics of cell infection and viral replication. Toward this goal, we apply global sensitivity methods (Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis and Latin Hypercube Sampling) to a physiologically faithful, stochastic, spatial model of inhaled SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection in the human respiratory tract. We focus on the nasal passage as the primary origin of respiratory infection and site of clinical testing, and we simulate the spatial and dynamic progression of shed viral load and infected cells in the immediate 48 hours post infection. We impose immune evasion, i.e., suppressed immune protection, based on the preponderance of clinical evidence that nasal infections occur rapidly post exposure, largely independent of immune status. Global sensitivity methods provide the de-correlated outcome sensitivities to each source of within-host heterogeneity, including the dynamic progression of sensitivities at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post infection. The results reveal a dynamic rank-ordering of the drivers of outcome sensitivity in early infection, providing insights into the dramatic population-scale outcome diversity during the COVID-19 pandemic. While we focus on SARS-CoV-2, the model and methods are applicable to any inhaled virus in the immediate 48 hours post infection.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

98,The serum levels of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies remain detectable at 9 months post covid-19 in systematically screened kidney transplant recipients,,"Aims and Background: The kinetics of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration following COVID-19 remains unclear in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Furthermore, a comparative follow-up between asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients has not been done thus far. Method(s): Systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the DIASORIN chemiluminescence immunoassay SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG was performed in KTRs from June, 1st to October, 1st 2020. Patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 via a nasopharyngeal swab were similarly included and tested. The serum concentration of antibodies was prospectively followed in each patient at different time-points: at 3 +/- 1; at 6 +/- 1; and at 9 +/- 1 months. Patients were further classified as symptomatic (Group S) or asymptomatic (Group aS) upon clinical criteria. Result(s): Serology was prospectively tested in 525 KTRs. Among them, 28 KTRs had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (>15 UA/ml), including 7 asymptomatic patients (25%). Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 50 years [40; 63], and 7 (25%) were women. In Group S, 3 patients (14%) showed no serologic conversion. During the follow-up, anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG were detectable in 84% at M3, in 76% at M6, and in 70% at M9 in Group S. In 3 patients of Group S, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG disappeared during the study period (2 at M6 and 1 at M9). In Group aS, all patients remained seropositive at the last follow-up. In the whole population, the serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed a non-significant decrease from a median [IQR] value of 51 UA/ml [22; 127] at M3 to 39 UA/ml [8; 70] at M9 (p = 0.08 for the Wilcoxon test). Conclusion(s): Our prospective and systematic cohort suggests that the serologic response against SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs persists at 9 months post COVID-19 in most cases in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.",Firket L.; Huynen P.; Bouquegneau A.; Bonvoisin C.; Grosch S.; Jouret F.; Weekers L.,,1432-2277,/10.1111/tri.13944,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2ftri.13944,0,0,,78
88,"Prospective Study of 1,308 Nasopharyngeal Swabs from 1,033 Patients using the LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test: Comparison with RT-qPCR",,"BACKGROUND: Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. Previously, we demonstrated the accuracy of the quantitative LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 antigen test using samples collected retrospectively. Here, the antigen test was clinically validated using prospective samples. METHOD(S): A total of 1,033 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected 1,033 individuals and an additional 275 follow-up samples were collected from 43 patients who later tested positive for COVID-19. All 1,308 samples were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and the LUMIPULSE antigen test. Antibody response was investigated for patients with discordant results to clarify whether seroconversion had occurred. RESULT(S): RT-qPCR identified 990 samples as negative and 43 as positive, while the antigen test identified 992 as negative, 37 as positive, and 4 as inconclusive. The overall concordance rate was 99.7% (1,026/1,029). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 92.5% (37/40), 100% (989/989), 100% (37/37) and of 99.7% (989/992), respectively, after excluding the four inconclusive results. The kappa coefficient was 0.960 (95% confidence interval, 0.892-0.960), suggesting excellent agreement between the two tests. The seropositive in five out of the seven patients with discordant results suggested that the discrepancy was caused by samples collected during the late phase of infection. Using the follow-up samples, we observed a correlation between the antigen level and the viral load or threshold cycle (Ct) value. The concordance rate between these test results tended to be high among samples collected up to 9 days after symptom onset but this gradually decreased thereafter. CONCLUSION(S): This prospective study demonstrated that the LUMIPULSE antigen test is a highly accurate diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2021.

113,Lack of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion after prompt identification and cohorting of sentinel SARS-CoV-2-positive residents in a skilled nursing facility,,"Background: Despite numerous outbreaks, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) are not well described. We reviewed serological test results in a cohort of SNF residents who had been repetitively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Method(s): In late March 2019, we identified symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents at a SNF. In response, all remaining SNF patients were serially screened, and all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were transferred to the acute care hospital or cohorted in a separate COVID Recovery Unit (CRU) in the SNF. In early June, all SNF residents (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative) underwent serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1/S2) IgG (DiaSorin). DiaSorin IgG-positive results for patients that were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative were reflexed to nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott). Antibody testing occurred a median of 69 days (63-70 IQR) after PCR positivity. Result(s): Nineteen SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents were identified from the outbreak and an additional 9 were transferred from the acute care hospital to the CRU; 1 died and 1 received convalescent plasma leaving 26 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents, including 6 who were asymptomatic, that were eligible for serologic testing. Twenty-four of the 26 were positive for IgG by the DiaSorin assay; one seronegative resident was one of the asymptomatic residents. There were an additional 121 residents in the SNF whose SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative at least once. Among these 121 SNF residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all but two were seronegative by the Diasorin assay. The two seropositive residents had no nucleocapsid antibodies when reflex tested by the Abbott assay. Conclusion(s): In a limited sample of SNF residents with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, the sensitivity of the Diasorin assay was 92% (24/26) and the specificity was 98% (119/121). None of the residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR had confirmed positive antibody results using reflex testing (DiaSorin/Abbott). Despite high risk exposure in congregate living facilities, we found no evidence of additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure, reinforcing the importance of serial surveillance SARS-CoV-2 testing and early cohorting in SNF settings.

64,The Spectrum of Manifestations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) Infection in Children: What We Can Learn From Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is defined as a clinically serious condition requiring hospitalization with fever, multi-system organ disfunction, inflammatory biomarkers increase. The syndrome develops in the context of a probable or ascertained Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection, but other possible etiologies should be ruled out for definitive diagnosis. On the clinical side, along with the multi-system involvement, myocarditis with heart failure and shock is the most striking feature. Capillary leak is another fundamental feature of MIS-C. In fact, shock and hemodynamic compromise in MIS-C can occur also in the absence of laboratory evidence of myocardial inflammation, with preserved cardiac function and rapid reversibility. Since the first observations of MIS-C patients, it was evident that there is a delay between the peak of adult cases of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and the MIS-C peak. Moreover, SARS-Cov2 isolation in children with MIS-C is not always possible, due to low viral load, while positive serology is far more commonly observed. These observations lead to the interpretation of MIS-C as a post-infectious disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of MIS-C is far from being elucidated, it is clear that it is a hyperinflammatory disease with a different inflammatory response as compared to what is seen in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that the disease shares some, but not all, immunological features with Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), Kawasaki Disease (KD), Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Different mechanisms have been hypothesized as being responsible, from molecular mimicry to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Some evidence has also been collected on the immunological profile of patients with MIS-C and their difference from COVID-19. This review is focused on critical aspects of MIS-C clinical presentation and pathogenesis, and different immunological profiles. We propose a model where this hyperinflammatory disease represents one manifestation of the SARS-CoV2 spectrum in children, going from asymptomatic carriers to the post-infectious MIS-C, through symptomatic children, a low number of which may suffer from a severe infection with hyperinflammation (pediatric Hyper-COVID).© Copyright © 2021 Panaro and Cattalini.",Panaro S.; Cattalini M.,,2296-858X (electronic),/10.3389/fmed.2021.747190,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3389%2ffmed.2021.747190,0,0,,81

40,"SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence in Malawi Based on Data from Survey of Communities and Health Workers in 5 High-Burden Districts, October 2020",,"To determine early COVID-19 burden in Malawi, we conducted a multistage cluster survey in 5 districts. During October-December 2020, we recruited 5,010 community members (median age 32 years, interquartile range 21-43 years) and 1,021 health facility staff (HFS) (median age 35 years, interquartile range 28-43 years). Real-time PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence was 0.3% (95% CI 0.2%-0.5%) among community and 0.5% (95% CI 0.1%-1.2%) among HFS participants; seroprevalence was 7.8% (95% CI 6.3%-9.6%) among community and 9.7% (95% CI 6.4%-14.5%) among HFS participants. Most seropositive community (84.7%) and HFS (76.0%) participants were asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was higher among urban community (12.6% versus 3.1%) and HFS (14.5% versus 7.4%) than among rural community participants. Cumulative infection findings 113-fold higher from this survey than national statistics (486,771 versus 4,319) and predominantly asymptomatic infections highlight a need to identify alternative surveillance approaches and predictors of severe disease to inform national response.Copyright © 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

93,Seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 antibodies in transplant recipients in a croatian transplant center,,"Purpose: In Croatia, the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been reported on 25 February 2020; however, the COVID-19 seroprevalence in the liver (LTR) and kidney transplant recipients (KTR) is presently unknown. Method(s): From 9 September to 13 November 2020, at the beginning of the second wave COVID-19 epidemic curve in Croatia, we performed a systematic screening for COVID-19 in outpatient solid organ transplant recipients (n=495). Serum samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Serological tests were performed by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antigens (Vircell, Granada, Spain). Result(s): LTR (n=265) were older than KTR (n=230) (59.8+/-10.7 vs 51.8+/-12.1 years, p<0.01). Out of 495 transplant recipients, 97 (19.6%) were positive for anti-SARSCoV-2-IgG. There was no difference in the seroprevalence between LTR and KTR, 20.4% vs. 18.7%, respectively, p>0.05. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG were found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, seropositive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever (25.3% vs. 12.8%, p=0.011) and anosmia (5.2% vs 0.9% p=0.023). Out of 97 anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG positives, only 22% reported previous nasal-throat swabs RT-PCR testing, with 28.6% of them being SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. Conclusion(s): In Croatia, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in LTR and KTR is 19.6% with seropositivity documented in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

Method(s): We aim to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection contracted during 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy during the first two COVID-19 waves across a prospective French multicenter cohort study. Patients were included between April 2020 and January 2021 in 10 maternity hospitals in Paris area with two groups (i) pregnant women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR between [14WG; 37WG[(symptomatic infection), (ii) pregnant women with a negative serology (or equivocal) at delivery and without a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at any time during pregnancy (G2 group) Main findings: 2410 pregnant women were included, of whom 310 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and 217 between [14WG; 37WG[. Most infections occurred between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation (56 %). Most patients could be managed as outpatients, while 23 % had to be hospitalized. Among women with a positive RT-PCR, multiparous women were over-represented (OR = 2.45[1.52;3.87]); were more likely to deliver before 37 weeks of gestation (OR = 2.19[1.44;3.24]) and overall cesarean deliveries were significantly increased (OR = 1.53[1.09;2.13]).

99,Development of antibody response to sarscov- 2 following asymptomatic infection in patients with plasma cell disorders on immunomodulatory therapy,,"Background: Plasma cell disorder (PCD) patients are extremely vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to disease-related impaired humoral and cellular immunity as well as the receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. Reported mortality in a large cohort of patients with plasma cell disorders is 33%. The roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine is welcomed in this population, however there is concern of suboptimal antibody responses, from previous experience with the influenza vaccine. There is urgent need to understand the humoral response to SARSCoV- 2 infection in these patients, in the context of systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT). Aim(s): We aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a cohort of PCD patients, the relationship with symptomatic infection, PCD characteristics and receipt of SACT. Method(s): SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening with the Elecsys Anti-SARSCoV- 2 assay (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), a semi-quantitative assay of IgG and IgM against the nucleocapsid (N) antigen was introduced for PCD patients at our institution in July 2020. Clinical information was retrieved from the medical records. Patients with unexpected positive antibody tests were asked about possible past contacts and exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): We report on a six-month period of routine SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening. Two-hundred and forty-three PCD patients had one antibody test, 106 had serial samples. Total seroprevalence was 10.7% (26/243), of which 12 were patients with known PCR-swab positive COVID-19 disease. In a separate but overlapping cohort, 41 patients have had PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease; 20 of these patients were tested, and 12 (60%) had seroconverted. Median time to testing from positive PCR test in the antibody positive patients was 86.5 days (range 22-256) and in antibody negative patients, 30.5 days (range 5-176 days). No PCD or COVID-19 disease factors were found to influence the likelihood of mounting an antibody response after PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease in these 20 patients. In our screened cohort, 14 (6.3%) patients were unexpectedly antibody positive. Their clinical course is summarised in the included figure. The majority 85.7% (12/14) of patients described no COVID-19 symptoms. Seven (50%) patients were on SACT (including ixazomib, pomalidomide, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combinations) throughout the period from possible exposure to positive antibody test, with no interruption to their ongoing oral immunomodulatory treatment. Ten antibody positive patients had serial positive results at median 45 days (range 21-119) apart, demonstrating persistence, but some decline in titre over time. Summary/Conclusion: Our seroprevalence of 10.7% is lower but not dissimilar to that reported in the London population over a similar time period reflecting shielding behaviours in our patients but also the challenges of protecting them during high SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the community. Nevertheless, PCD patients retain the ability to seroconvert, even with asymptomatic COVID-19 disease and while on immunomodulatory therapy. Seroconversion rates following symptomatic infection appear lower however, with evidence of delay compared to the general population. These data support the advice for COVID-19 vaccination to be offered to all PCD patients although the suboptimal humoral response calls for close antibody monitoring of all vaccinated PCD patients and timely booster doses.",Chan W.Y.; Sanchez E.; Chavda S.; Lecat C.; Ainley L.; Xu K.; Wisniowski B.; Mahmood S.; Papanikolaou X.; Kyriakou C.; Sive J.; Wechalekar A.; Popat R.; Rabin N.; Lee L.; Nastouli E.; Yong K.,,2572-9241,/10.1097/HS9.0000000000000566,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1097%2fHS9.0000000000000566,0,0,,90
130,"SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak on a Spanish Mink Farm: Epidemiological, Molecular, and Pathological Studies.",2021,"Farmed minks have been reported to be highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and may represent a risk to humans. In this study, we describe the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurred on a mink farm in Spain, between June and July 2020, involving 92,700 animals. The outbreak started shortly after some farm workers became seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Minks showed no clinical signs compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the outbreak. Samples from 98 minks were collected for histopathological, serological, and molecular studies. Twenty out of 98 (20.4%) minks were positive by RT-qPCR and 82 out 92 (89%) seroconverted. This finding may reflect a rapid spread of the virus at the farm with most of the animals overcoming the infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR in 30% of brain samples from positive minks. Sequencing analysis showed that the mink sequences were not closely related with the other mink SARS-CoV-2 sequences available, and that this mink outbreak has its probable origin in one of the genetic variants that were prevalent in Spain during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. Histological studies revealed bronchointerstitial pneumonia in some animals. Immunostaining of viral nucleocapsid was also observed in nasal turbinate tissue. Farmed minks could therefore constitute an important SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, contributing to virus spread among minks and humans. Consequently, continuous surveillance of mink farms is needed.

81,Positive impact of oral hydroxychloroquine and povidone-iodine throat spray for COVID-19 prophylaxis: An open-label randomized trial,,"Background: We examined whether existing licensed pharmacotherapies could reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 mug/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. Result(s): A total of 3037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2-42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7-39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, -5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, -10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%), and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%). Conclusion(s): Chemoprophylaxis with either oral hydroxychloroquine or povidone-iodine throat spray was superior to oral vitamin C in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and healthy men.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Seet R.C.S.; Quek A.M.L.; Ooi D.S.Q.; Sengupta S.; Lakshminarasappa S.R.; Koo C.Y.; So J.B.Y.; Goh B.C.; Loh K.S.; Fisher D.; Teoh H.L.; Sun J.; Cook A.R.; Tambyah P.A.; Hartman M.,,1201-9712,/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.035,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.ijid.2021.04.035,0,0,,93
58,A SUDDEN INCREASE IN CHILDREN WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS T1DM DURING THE PEAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - IS THERE AN ASSOCIATION?,,"Aims To assess if there is any temporal association between the sudden high incidence of newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in children and the onset of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoviD19) in Harlow, Essex UK. Methods Design An observational study Setting Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (PAH), District General Hospital Over a period of 6 weeks between end April to start of June 2020, there were 10 cases of new onset T1DM who presented to our paediatric department. We reviewed the demographics, symptomatology and biochemical presentations of these patients (table 1). Bloods including SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody were taken at first presentation and patients had nasal swabs for SARS-COV-2 PCR. Families of patients provided written consent to take part in the project. Antibody testing with HSL Roche kit (sensitivity of 97% at D14-21 and 100% at D40) was processed at PAH microbiology laboratory. All data collators had updated training in Good Clinical Practice GCP and Consenting in paediatric e-learning modules on NIHR Learning Management Systems platform. Primary outcomes assessed the association of new onset T1DM with COVID-19 IgG positivity. Secondary outcomes assessed the degree of severity of T1DM at presentation through severity of acidosis and level of HbA1c. Clinical presentations were evaluated to assess any patterns through the cases. We also aimed to check for any demographic similarities. We derived interquartile ranges (IQR = Q3-Q1) between Q1 25% to Q3 75% to adjust for outliers in the dataset Results Only one case was detected to have IgG antibodies at the time of presentation (not in DKA). Median age of presentation was 9.5 years. The youngest being 11 months and oldest, 14 years. There were 7 males, and 3 females in the cohort. 50% of cases were not in DKA. Of those who presented with ketosis, 2 were in severe DKA (most severe at pH 6.94). None needed intensive care management. Median HbA1c at presentation was 123.5 mmol/mol. Median duration of symptoms was 23.8 days, with those not in DKA presenting on average 17 days and those in DKA (20%) presenting longer (30 days). Those in severe DKA had higher HbA1c values (143 and 151 mmol/mol). There were comorbidities of previously diagnosed autism and hypothyroidism at diagnosis of T1DM in one solitary case (not in DKA). Covid19 antibody positive patient had a history of parent succumbing to COVID-19. Demographics - 30% cases hailed from Harlow, 20% from Broxbourne and Bishops Stortford. 10% were from Waltham abbey, Waltham cross and Epping areas each. Conclusion Our small study represents an exponential rise (three-fold increase) in cases of new onset T1DM shortly following the first pandemic peak in April 2020. Only one case showed presence of past COVID-19 infection. The sampling of antibodies was limited by lack of widespread rollout of coronavirus testing at the time. Our findings support the observation that delay in diagnosis resulted in increasing patient numbers presenting in DKA. There was no association between CoVId-19 infection and new onset T1DM in children. We look forward to outcomes of larger scale studies examining this issue.",Namasivayam A.; Haworth E.; Nuti A.,,1468-2044,/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.433,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1136%2farchdischild-2022-rcpch.433,0,0,,94
84,Prevalence and Clinical Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Silent Carriers Among Actively Treated Patients with Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic,,"Introduction: In Europe, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had its first epicenter in Italy. Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. Result(s): In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. Conclusion(s): Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. Implications for Practice: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.Copyright © 2020 AlphaMed Press",Zambelli A.; Chiudinelli L.; Fotia V.; Negrini G.; Bosetti T.; Callegaro A.; Di Croce A.; Caremoli E.R.; Moro C.; Milesi L.; Poletti P.; Tasca C.; Mandala M.; Merelli B.; Mosconi S.; Arnoldi E.; Bettini A.; Bonomi L.; Messina C.; Ghilardi L.; Chirco A.; Maracino M.; Tondini C.,,1083-7159,/10.1002/onco.13654,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1002%2fonco.13654,0,0,,95
54,"Post-vaccination SARS-cov-2 infection in nursing home residents, Bordeaux, France",,"Objective: To describe COVID-19 breakthrough infections in two nursing homes (NHs) sites of active COVID-19 clusters despite optimal vaccination coverage. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted in two NHs of south-western France, following the investigation of COVID-19 clusters (February-March 2021). SARS-CoV-2-confirmed infection was defined by positive RT-PCR. Antibodies neutralization capacities were tested in a subgroup of fully-vaccinated and seropositive-residents. Result(s): Of the 152 residents, 66% were female with median age 87 years (IQR: 80.0-90.2). Overall, 132 (87%) residents received 2 doses of vaccine, 14 (9%) one dose and 6 (4%) were unvaccinated. Forty-seven (31%) residents had confirmed infection (45 (98%) with variant 20I/501Y.V1). All 6 non-vaccinated residents, 4 /14 who had one dose and 37/132 that had two doses, were infected. Of the 39 residents reporting symptoms, 12 and 3 presented severe and critical disease, respectively. One resident with a confirmed infection died. Infected-residents had a median anti-S IgG titre of 19 116.0 (IQR: 3 028.0-39 681.8 AU/mL), 19 times higher than that of non-infected vaccinated persons (1,207.0; IQR: 494.0-2,782.0). In the subgroup of 19 residents tested for neutralizing antibodies, the neutralizing titre (50%) was strongly positively correlated with the anti-S IgG titre (correlation coefficient = 0.83), and 1.5 times higher for the infected than non-infected residents [5.9 (IQR: 5.3-6.9) vs. 3.6 (2.9-3.8)]. Conclusion(s): Institutionalized elderly persons who undergo breakthrough infection develop higher titres of anti-S IgGs, which are strongly correlated with the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies. These results advocate for additional vaccine doses in this population.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",Lartigau M.; Ouattara E.; Tumiotto C.; Wodrich H.; Busson L.; Trimoulet P.; Thiel E.; Nouzille M.; Dubos M.; Lafon M.-E.; Gilleron V.; Dehail P.; Salles N.; Malvy D.,,1386-6532,/10.1016/j.jcv.2022.105134,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.jcv.2022.105134,0,0,,96
135,A Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patient With COVID-19 Infection After Intensive Immunochemotherapy: A Case Report.,2020,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a global public health event. Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear. Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered. The impacts of anti-cancer treatment on COVID-19 infection need to be explored further.

We describe the study design and report baseline characteristics of the study participants, including the proportion of participants with acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment. Method(s): At enrollment and subsequent timepoints, participants recruited through digital and paper-based advertising campaigns reported their occupational and school-based exposure, risk factors, and behaviors, and provided nasal and serum specimens. Stratified enrichment was used to enhance enrollment into medium- and higher-risk groups within four occupational risk groups for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR and serologic (IgG) testing were conducted to detect acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants, respectively. Result(s): Between November 2020 and January 2021, 1008 participants (female 70.7%, mean age +/- SD 51 +/- 13.8 years) completed the questionnaire and diagnostic testing. Among participants, 41.8% (n = 421) were considered low risk, 24.6% (n = 248) were medium-to-low risk, 22.3% (n = 225) were medium-to-high risk, and 11.3% (n = 114) were high risk. Of 56 (5.6%) participants with evidence of acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, 11 (19.6%) were RT-PCR-positive, 36 (64.3%) were IgG-seropositive, and 9 (16.1%) were positive by both assays. Participants who were adherent vs nonadherent to social distancing measures (odds ratio [95% CI] 0.8 [0.4-1.8]) were less likely, while those in higher vs lower occupational risk groups (2.0 [1.0-4.4]) were more likely to have evidence for acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion(s): In fall/winter 2020/21, 5.6% of adults in a Lake County convenience sample had evidence for acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Nonadherence to social distancing measures and high-risk professions were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study is ongoing and future analyses will assess infection status over time.

Method(s): Five home care service companies in Stockholm, Sweden, enrolled 405 employees to a study including serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 virus in throat swabs. Result(s): 20.1% (81/403) of employees were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n = 3671; 9.7% seropositivity). 13/379 employees (3.4%) had a current infection (PCR positivity). Amongst these, 5 were also seropositive and 3 were positive with low amounts of virus. High amounts of virus and no antibodies (a characteristic for presymptomatic COVID-19) were present in 5 employees (1.3%). Conclusion(s): Personnel providing home services for older persons appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2. Likely presymptomatic employees can be readily identified by screening.

35,The importance of combining serological testing with RT-PCR assays for efficient detection of COVID-19 and higher diagnostic accuracy,,"Misdiagnosing suspected COVID-19 individuals could largely contribute to the viruses transmission, therefore, making an accurate diagnosis of infected subjects vital in minimizing and containing the disease. Although RT-PCR is the standard method in detecting COVID-19, it is associated with some limitations, including possible false negative results. Therefore, serological testing has been suggested as a complement assay to RT-PCR to support the diagnosis of acute infections. In this study, 15 out of 639 unvaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) were tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR and were found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. These participants underwent additional confirmatory RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific ELISA tests. Of the 15 individuals, nine participants were found negative by second RT-PCR but seropositive for anti-spike IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies confirming their acute infection. At the time of collection, these nine individuals were in close contact with COVID-19-confirmed patients, with 77.7% reporting COVID-19-related symptoms. These results indicate that including serological tests in the current testing profile can provide better outcomes and help contain the spread of the virus by increasing diagnostic accuracy to prevent future outbreaks rapidly.Copyright 2023 Alamri et al.",Alamri S.S.; Alsaieedi A.; Khouqeer Y.; Afeef M.; Alharbi S.; Algaissi A.; Alghanmi M.; Altorki T.; Zawawi A.; Alfaleh M.A.; Hashem A.M.; Alhabbab R.,,2167-8359 (electronic),/10.7717/PEERJ.15024,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.7717%2fPEERJ.15024,0,0,,102
114,Use of IVIG in three immunosuppressed patients hospitalized with COVID-19,,"Background: The use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with severe COVID-19 is currently under investigation. Preliminary data report shorter length of stay and reduced use of mechanical ventilation in patients receiving IVIG. Little is known about the safety and effectiveness of IVIG in an immunosuppressed population with COVID-19. Objective(s): We will describe the use of IVIG in hospitalized patients with neuroinflammatory diseases on chronic immunotherapy presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Data was collected prospectively through direct inpatient care as well as follow up via outpatient visits and telephone calls. Result(s): We treated three patients admitted to our hospital with IVIG. Patient 1 is a 30-year-old man with antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica (NMO) treated with rituximab 650mg every 3 months with undetectable CD19+ B lymphocytes who presented with multifocal pneumonia and mild hypoxia. His absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 600/mm3 on admission. Patient 2 is a 54-year-old woman with CNS vasculitis treated with mycophenolate mofetil 2g daily and one dose of Rituximab 1g five months prior who presented with fever, cough and pneumonia. ALC was 600/mm3. Patient 3 is a 56-year-old woman with antibody-positive NMO, autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune myositis on mycophenolate mofetil 2.5g daily who presented with hypoxemia requiring high-flow nasal cannula. ALC was 700/ mm3. Immunotherapy was held on admission for all patients. They were given 0.4g/kg IVIG (Gammagard) daily for 5 days and prophylactic enoxaparin. IVIG was initiated on days 5, 4 and 3; patients were discharged on days 16, 10 and 17, respectively. The first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 clinically with later positive antibody testing to SARS-CoV2; the second two were diagnosed via SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR. All patients made a complete recovery without relapse of neuroinflammatory disease. Conclusion(s): All three patients had grade II lymphopenia on admission, which is known to be a marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19. None of our patients required intubation nor had side effects from IVIG. The use of IVIG may have prevented relapse provoked by viral illness as well as hastened recovery. Mechanisms of IVIG effect on coronavirus may be governed by sialosides on IgG serving as decoy receptors for the virus or IgG binding to sialosides on the viral surface and preventing viral attachment and fusion. IVIG may prevent an excessive inflammatory response by minimizing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Clinicians should carefully consider the risk and benefits when administering IVIG to a patient with SARS-CoV2. Finally, research on how lymphopenia affects outcomes of COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients is warranted.",Graham E.; Datar J.; Bevan C.; Grebenciucova E.; Koralnik I.; Cohen B.; Balabanov R.,,1477-0970,/10.1177/1352458520974938,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1177%2f1352458520974938,0,0,,103
115,Rates of asymptomatic carriage and antibody positivity for SARSCOV-2 in a large haemodialysis cohort,,"Background: Haemodialysis patients represent a unique challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic, balancing infection risk while safely providing life-sustaining haemodialysis. Asymptomatic infection rates in haemodialysis patients are unknown. Aim(s): 1 - To define rates of asymptomatic swab positivity in a cohort of prevalent haemodialysis patients 2 - To define rates of antibody positivity in patients known to have been historically swab positive 3 - To define rates of antibody positivity in patients without prior symptoms or clinical suspicion of COVID-19 Methods: A programme of COVID-19 screening using a validated nasopharyngeal PCR analysis was carried out across a prevalent cohort of 1253 haemodialysis patients. Concurrently all patients were offered antibody testing for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (Roche) and a total of 848 tests were completed. Result(s): 1 - Routine screening over a 4 week period from 4/5/20 to 1/6/20 confirmed 7 cases of asymptomatic swab positivity (0.6%). 2 - In our cohort there were 197 confirmed swab positive cases of COVID, and of the 153 survivors 124 were antibody positive (81%). 10 patients were highly clinically suspicious of COVID and managed as such; of those 3 were antibody positive (30%). 3 - Of the remaining swab negative patients who had antibody testing (n=710) 82 were antibody positive (11.5%). Conclusion(s): In a large inner-city London haemodialysis where the population prevalence of COVID has been high, we demonstrate 1 - low asymptomatic rates of virus carriage at this later stage in the pandemic 2 - significant proportions of swab positive patients seroconverting to be antibody positive 2 - suggestion that 11.5% of patients had previous been asymptomatic carriers and had seroconverted to be antibody positive.",Mccafferty K.; Davari M.; Price K.; Rajakariar R.; Cove-smith A.; Forbes S.H.,,1533-3450,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&AN=633703971,0,0,,104
62,Re-positive PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in health care persons during COVID-19 pandemic,,"Reinfection rate with SARS-CoV-2 and degree of protection by the induced antibody after the first episode of the infection is not well known, so it makes a big dilemma for health care personnel (HCP) who work in the front line of combating SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 redetection among HCP after the initial onset of the infection in a children's hospital during one year. Out of 131 seropositive HCP, 13.7% of them were symptomatic and PCR positive during 74-360 days after first sampling. Analysis of demographic data of seropositive HCP showed a correlation between a higher number of family members, higher body mass index, and the existence of underlying diseases with SARS-CoV-2 redetection. In conclusion, reinfection is one of the important problems in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Research on this topic can help us to find answers to questions for estimating the duration of human protection with produced immunity after the infection or vaccination.Copyright: © 2021 by the C.M.B.

6,Author response: Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis in COVID-19,,"We thank Drs. Ni and Xu for their letter on our study.1 We think that our 2 patients developed Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis because of an aberrant immunologic response to COVID-19. As we previously commented in the article, oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was positive in both patients and negative in the CSF. We did not examine the presence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF because that technique had not been validated. In the patient who acutely presented with Miller Fisher syndrome, CSF PCR for enterovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and varicella zoster virus were negative as well as CSF-VDRL test. On the other hand, in the patient with polyneuritis cranialis, these tests could not be performed because of the extreme circumstances of the University Hospital ""Principe de Asturias,""Alcala de Henares, Madrid, at the peak of this pandemic. Notwithstanding, considering the temporal relationship, we feel that SARS-CoV-2 infection was responsible for the development of these 2 neurologic pictures.

23,A CASE OF COVID VACCINE-ASSOCIATED ANTI-MDA5 ANTIBODY DERMATOMYOSITIS,,"SESSION TITLE: Diffuse Lung Disease Case Report Posters 5 SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/09/2023 12:00 pm - 12:45 pm INTRODUCTION: Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5-positive dermatomyositis (Anti-MDA5 ab DM) is an uncommon autoimmune condition with a 6 month mortality rate as high as 50% due to high risk of developing rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD). Incidence of RP-ILD in conjunction with Anti-MDA5 antibody DM is between 50-80%. We present a case of Anti-MDA5 ab DM with associated RP-ILD after COVID and influenza vaccination. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and untreated latent TB was evaluated as an outpatient on 4 occasions over a 2 month period for progressive shortness of breath, polyarticular joint pain, weight loss and malaise beginning shortly after her influenza and second COVID booster vaccine. She was referred to rheumatology and treated with short courses of prednisone for an inflammatory arthritis. Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the Emergency Department with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal cannula. Initial workup was notable for severely elevated ESR and CRP, elevated PTT and AST, a normal white count with decreased lymphocytes, and 1+ protein on UA. Chest imaging revealed extensive multifocal ground glass opacities.Within 24 hours she required intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage was notable for a positive Pneumocystis jiroveci PCR for which she was treated with TMP/SMX and methylprednisolone. On hospital day 6 she was initiated on venovenous (VV) ECMO. Rheumatologic workup later revealed positive anti-MDA5 ab. Immunotherapy was initiated with high dose prednisone and then cyclophosphamide following treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP). Unfortunately she never experienced meaningful recovery of pulmonary function and as she was not a candidate for lung transplant, she eventually succumbed to her illness on hospital day 51. DISCUSSION: This patient with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease due to Anti-MDA5 antibody-positive dermatomyositis was initially difficult to diagnose due to concern for other causes of acute respiratory failure, in particular PJP. Prior small studies have shown increased incidence of myositis-related anti-RNA-synthetases auto-antibodies after administration of COVID mRNA vaccine. Our suspicion is that this patient developed anti-MDA5 ab as a result of her COVID mRNA vaccination and subsequent development of RP-ILD was secondary to her anti-MDA5 DM. CONCLUSION(S): This case highlights the importance of recognition of this rare dermatomyositis, in particular given the rise of production of auto-antibodies after widespread COVID vaccination. Despite this rare and catastrophic outcome, the benefits of COVID vaccination remain at the forefront of population health. Early recognition of the severe complication of RP-ILD may help with diagnosis and early initiation of directed therapies. REFERENCE #1: McPherson M, Economidou S, Liampas A, Zis P, Parperis K.

92,Anti-CD20 therapies are associated with decreased seropositivity in patients with multiple sclerosis and related diseases: one-year pandemic experience of the New York COVID-19 Neuroimmunology Consortium (NYCNIC),,"Introduction: Patients with MS and related conditions may be at higher risk for COVID-19 complications due to disease or medication- related factors. Elucidating those factors is imperative for appropriate counseling of patients. Objective(s): To determine outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with MS and related conditions, and to determine predictors of these outcomes. Aim(s): To assess impact of COVID-19 in MS patients. Method(s): This was a multicenter, observational cohort study of patients with MS or related CNS autoimmune disorders who developed confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection from 2/1/2020 to 12/31/2020. Patients from 5 MS centers in New York City and tri-state area were identified by the treating neurologist. The primary outcome measure was hospitalization status due to COVID-19. Data relating to COVID-19 symptoms, diagnostic testing including SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab results (NAAT or antigen testing) and SARS-CoV-2 serologic status as well as data regarding potential risk factors and comorbidities was obtained. Result(s): Of 474 patients in the study, 63.3% had confirmed COVID-19 infection and 93.9% were diagnosed with an MS phenotype. Mean age was 45+/-13 (mean+/-SD) years, 72% were female, and 86% were treated with a DMT at the time of infection. 58 patients (12.2%) were hospitalized. 24 patients (5.1%) were critically ill (requiring ICU care or outcome of death), of which 15 patients (3.2%) died. Higher neurological disability and older age independently predicted hospitalization. There was no association between specific DMTs or DMT classes and COVID-19 severity. 85% (102/120) of patients with known antibody results who were not treated with anti-CD20 therapies were seropositive while only 39.5% (17/43) of patients being treated with anti-CD20 demonstrated seropositivity (p<0.0001). Only 25% (2/8) of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 being treated with anti-CD20 therapies demonstrated seropositivity. Conclusions and relevance: In this multicenter study, neurological disability and older age were independent predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These findings will improve counseling of patients regarding risk from COVID-19. Additionally, the results demonstrate that anti-CD20 therapies significantly blunt humoral responses post-infection, a finding that carries potential implications with regards to natural or vaccine- mediated immunity.",Klineova S.; Harel A.; Straus Farber R.; DeAngelis T.; Zhang Y.; Hentz R.; Leung T.M.; Fong K.; Smith T.; Blanck R.; Zhovtis-Ryerson L.,,1477-0970,/10.1177/13524585211044647,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1177%2f13524585211044647,0,0,,108
112,A Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patient With COVID-19 Infection After Intensive Immunochemotherapy: A Case Report,,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a global public health event. Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear. Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured. Conclusion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered. The impacts of anti-cancer treatment on COVID-19 infection need to be explored further.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Zhu, Xiao, Liu, Liu, Wu and Zhang.",Li Q.; Zhu F.; Xiao Y.; Liu T.; Liu X.; Wu G.; Zhang L.,,2234-943X (electronic),/10.3389/fonc.2020.00924,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffonc.2020.00924,0,0,,109
96,A case of COVID-19 encephalitis with anti-gfap antibody-positive meningoencephalomyelitis,,"Background and aims: Neurological manifestations are increasingly recognised in COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (Ab)-mediated astrocytopathy can have parainfectious aetiologies. Method(s): We describe a patient with COVID-19 and adenovirus encephalitis preceding anti-GFAP meningoencephalomyelitis. Result(s): A woman, 49, was admitted with headache, fever and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR. Over 72-hours, she developed drowsiness and confusion. CT head was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed leukocyte 28 mm3, protein 0.8 g/dL and glucose 2.2 mmol/L. She started empirical intravenous acyclovir and cefotaxime. MRI brain following improved agitation demonstrated right temporal T2 hyperintensities. On Day 10, CSF returned positive SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus PCR (HSV, VZV, enterovirus PCR and microbial culture negative). COVID-19 and adenovirus encephalitis was diagnosed. 5-days dexamethasone and 14-days total aciclovir were given with clinical improvement. However, on Day 20, she developed new quadriparesis, myoclonus and fluctuating consciousness. Repeat MRI revealed new right temporal and parietal T2 hyperintensities, patchy enhancing cord lesions, and cauda equina and conus medullaris meningeal enhancement. Repeat CSF showed leukocyte 185/mm^3 (90% lymphocytes), protein 1.9 g/dL, glucose 1.3 mmol/L, with negative SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus PCR. Serum and CSF anti-GFAP Ab were positive (titres: 1:128 and 1:64). Other autoimmune encephalitis/paraneoplastic/connective-tissue Abs and infective/malignancy screens were negative.

109,"Serum interleukin-6 concentrations and the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia: A retrospective study at a single center in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, China, in January and February 2020",,"Background: At present, the relationships among COVID-19 disease progression, patient prognosis, and immune status are unclear. This single-center retrospective study evaluated the correlation between serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels at admission with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, as determined by admission to the intensive Care Unit (ICU). Material/Methods: Patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, China, in January and February 2020 for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swab samples using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription PCR. Serum IL-6 concentrations at admission were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum IL-6 concentrations and ICU admission due to the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Result(s): This study enrolled 68 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe than less severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia became critically ill and required ICU admission. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were than who were not treated in the ICU. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.816 (P<0.01), indicating that IL-6 was prognostic of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

68,Thyroiditis following vaccination against COVID-19: Report of two cases and review of the literature,,"Introduction: Immune response following viral infections has been suggested as a probable mechanism leading to subacute thyroiditis (SAT). A few cases of SAT following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019. Cases of SAT after vaccination against influenza have also been reported. We describe two female patients with thyroiditis after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Presentation of cases: The first patient presented with fever and pain in the thyroid area typical of SAT two weeks after vaccination with the BNT162B2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine. The second patient presented with biochemical and imaging features consistent with silent thyroiditis three weeks after vaccination with the ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) vaccine. Both patients were asymptomatic prior to vaccination and PCR of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses associated with SAT was negative. Serology testing for measles, mumps, rubella, CMV and EBV viruses was suggestive of immunity. Antibody titre against spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was measured for both patients and was indicative of adequate post vaccination antibody response. Two months after initial assessment, both patients were euthyroid and asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): Subacute as well as silent thyroiditis may rarely occur after vaccination against COVID-19. Further research is needed to investigate the prevalence and pathogenesis of thyroid dysfunction following vaccination against COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Siolos A.; Gartzonika K.; Tigas S.,,2589-9368 (electronic),/10.1016/j.metop.2021.100136,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.metop.2021.100136,0,0,,114
8,Whooping Cough Cases Increase in Central Italy after COVID-19 Pandemic,,"Pertussis continues to be a highly contagious respiratory infection, especially in children, with cyclical peaks of disease spread every three to five years. Here, we report relevant cases of B. pertussis infection between August 2023 and January 2024, and compare them with B. pertussis prevalence in pediatric patients admitted to the Reference Italian Pediatric Hospital, located in Rome, from January 2015 to July 2023. A total of 5464 tests for B. pertussis were performed during the study period, and 6.9% were positive. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a sharp decrease in the presence of B. pertussis, which reappeared only in August 2023, recording five new cases. All five children presented with paroxysmal cough 5 to 10 days before admission. Four patients had other mild respiratory symptoms and moderate B. pertussis DNA levels (Ct mean: 26). Only one child, with very high B. pertussis DNA levels (Ct: 9), presented with severe respiratory failure. The patients with mild/moderate infection achieved clinical recovery while the patient with the severe manifestation died of cardiac arrest. These observations highlight the reemergence of pertussis even in vaccinated countries and its association with morbidity and mortality especially in young children.

52,SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Positivity and Seroprevalence among Health Care Workers in a Referral Cancer Institute: A Cross-sectional Study,,"BACKGROUND: During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) are presumed to be at increased risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitting the infection to vulnerable patients if they are not timeously isolated. AIM: This study aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of HCWs providing oncology services. METHODS AND RESULTS: HCWs in a large referral cancer hospital in Egypt were tested using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, and immunochromatography-based rapid serological test (RST). Clinical and epidemiological data were collected. In 2020, 999 HCWs were screened, of whom 86 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (8.6%) and 127 subjects were seropositive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by RST (12.8%). Immunoglobulin M seroprevalence demonstrated considerable concordance with RT-PCR positivity (sensitivity 82.14% and specificity 96.71%). Most HCWs (>95%) reported adherence to personal protective equipment. Patient transporters/cleaner were the group with the highest frequency of positive RT-PCR (19%) whereas laboratory and radiology technicians displayed the lowest frequency. Fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, fatigue and diarrhea were significantly associated with RT-PCR positivity, with increased likelihood of being positive with the presence of five or six simultaneous symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in screened HCWs is 8.6% by RT-PCR and seroprevalence is 12.8% by RST. Strict measures should be implemented to minimize transmission within healthcare settings and to the community. Our data support the importance of HCWs screening for SARS-CoV-2, taking in account the significant proportion of asymptomatic carriers.Copyright © 2022 Abdel-Rahman Zekri, Ola S.

16,Algorithms for testing COVID-19 focused on use of RT-PCR and high-affinity serological testing: A consensus statement from a panel of Latin American experts,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health, social, and economic crisis. Improving understanding on available tests for detecting COVID-19 is critical for effective management of the pandemic. We proposed that a multidisciplinary expert panel can establish recommendations on ideal use of diagnostic tools, with a focus on RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests for the Latin America region. Study design: A collaborative multidisciplinary panel of 5 recognized experts in Latin America (an infectious disease specialist, three pathologists, and an immunologist) was convened and supported by Roche Diagnostics to develop standard guidelines and an evidence-based document of best practices on the use of diagnostic tools for COVID-19. Result(s): The authors reached consensus on the applicability of diagnostic tools to provide testing algorithms for the use of RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests in three settings: 1) For asymptomatic subjects exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infected person; 2) For epidemiological purposes and; 3) For symptomatic subjects. Conclusion(s): The serological high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests play a key role in COVID-19 diagnosis. These tests can be applied for suspected false-negative RT-PCR results and for individual determination of response. The use of these tests can also contribute greatly to public health strategies, such as population screening and supporting vaccination planning. Serological status for high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) should be performed ideally 21 days after potential infectious contact, given that the majority of exposed individuals will have seroconverted.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Ferreira C.E.; Bonvehi P.E.; de la Torre J.C.G.; Saenz-Flor K.V.; Condino-Neto A.,,1201-9712,/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.173,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.ijid.2020.11.173,0,0,,117
107,Most chilblains observed during the COVID-19 outbreak occur in patients who are negative for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction and serology testing*,,"Background: Acral lesions, mainly chilblains, are the most frequently reported cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. In more than 80% of patients tested, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed. Method(s): A national survey was launched on 30 March 2020 by the French Society of Dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations. Result(s): We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations [58.5% women, median age 25.7 years (range 18-39)]. The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains. Overall, 12 patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Of the 150 (48%) patients who were tested, 10 patients were positive. Seven of 121 (6%) RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and five of 75 (7%) serology-tested patients had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. Tested/untested patients or those with/without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral lesion clinical characteristics. Conclusion(s): The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains, but we found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France. What is already known about this topic?. About 1000 cases of acral lesions, mainly chilblains, were reported during the COVID-19 outbreak. Chilblains were reported to occur in young people within 2 weeks of infectious signs, which were mild when present. Most cases did not have COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and few serology results were available. What does this study add?. Among 311 patients with acral lesions, mainly chilblains, during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France, the majority of patients tested had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, 70 of 75 patients were seronegative for SARS-Cov-2 serology and 114 of 121 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.Copyright © 2020 British Association of Dermatologists",Le Cleach L.; Dousset L.; Assier H.; Fourati S.; Barbarot S.; Boulard C.; Bourseau Quetier C.; Cambon L.; Cazanave C.; Colin A.; Kostrzewa E.; Lesort C.; Levy Roy A.; Lombart F.; Marco-Bonnet J.; Monfort J.-B.; Samimi M.; Tardieu M.; Wolkenstein P.; Sbidian E.; Beylot-Barry M.,,0007-0963,/10.1111/bjd.19377,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.19377,0,0,,118
18,"Immunoglobulin (Ig)A seropositivity against SARSCoV- 2 in healthcare workers in Israel, 4 April to 13 July 2020: An observational study",,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare workers (HCW) at significant risk. Presence of antibodies can confirm prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Aim(s): This study investigates the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in HCW. Method(s): Performance of IgA and IgG antibody ELISA assays were initially evaluated in positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 serum samples. IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured in 428 asymptomatic HCW. We assessed the risk of two groups: HCW with high exposure risk outside work (HROW) residing in areas where COVID-19 was endemic (n = 162) and HCW with high exposure risk at work (HRAW) in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 97). Result(s): Sensitivities of 80% and 81.2% and specificities of 97.2% and 98% were observed for IgA and IgG antibodies, respectively. Of the 428 HCW, three were positive for IgG and 27 for IgA. Only 3/27 (11%) IgA-positive HCW had IgG antibodies compared with 50/62 (81%) in a group of previous SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive individuals. Consecutive samples from IgA-positive HCW demonstrated IgA persistence 18-83 days in 12/20 samples and IgG seroconversion in 1/20 samples. IgA antibodies were present in 8.6% of HROW and 2% of HRAW. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 exposure may lead to asymptomatic transient IgA response without IgG seroconversion. The significance of these findings needs further study. Out of work exposure is a possible risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW and infection in HCW can be controlled if adequate protective equipment is implemented.Copyright © 2021 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

51,Humoral Response in Hemodialysis Patients Following COVID-19 Vaccination and Breakthrough Infections during Delta and Omicron Variant Predominance,,"Background: The advancement of COVID-19 vaccination programs globally has been viewed as an integral strategy to reduce both the number of COVID-19 cases and consequential complications of COVID-19, particularly for high-risk patient groups. There are limited data on the antibody response and protection from disease infection and severity in patients requiring hemodial-ysis (HD) following COVID-19 vaccination during the Delta and Omicron variant predominance. We conducted a study aiming to evaluate humoral immunity derived from two different COVID-19 vaccines administered to our in-centre HD population and investigated the characteristics of breakthrough COVID-19 infections occurring post-vaccination within this population. Method(s): This is a prospective observational study including patients receiving HD at Salford Royal Hospital. The first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccinations (Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) were administered to this patient cohort since January 2021. The incidence of any breakthrough COVID-19 infections occurring in double vaccinated patients between 1 April 2021 and 15 January 2022 was recorded. Patients were screened weekly with nasal and pharyngeal nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19, whilst SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was performed alongside monthly routine HD bloods. Result(s): Four hundred eleven patients receiving HD were included in this study, of which 170 of 178 patients (95.5%) with available data on antibody status following two doses of the Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination had detectable antibody response, whilst this was the case for 97 of 101 patients (96.1%) who received two doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. For 12 seronegative patients who received a booster vaccine (third dose), nine seroconverted, while one remained negative and two were not tested. No statistically significant differences were observed with regards to antibody status between those receiving Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 and Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. Sixty-three of 353 patients with two doses of COVID-19 vaccination had breakthrough COVID-19 infection (40 during Delta and 23 during Omicron variant predominance). Of the 40 patients during the delta period, five were admitted into hospital and there were two reported deaths due to COVID-19-related illness. There were no COVID-19 associated hospitalizations or deaths during the Omicron variant predominance. Conclusion(s): The vast majority of HD patients who received two doses of the Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations developed detectable antibody responses. Our results support the value of booster vaccination with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine in HD patients and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance programmes with rRT-PCR and antibody testing for timely detection of positive cases.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

87,Resuming professional football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates: a prospective cohort study,,"OBJECTIVES: The risk of viral transmission associated with contact sports such as football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the infective and immune status of professional football players, team staff and league officials over a truncated football season resumed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates and to investigate the clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 infection in professional football players. METHOD(S): Prospective cohort study of 1337 football players, staff and officials during a truncated football season (9 weeks) with a tailored infection control programme based on preventive measures and regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing (every 3-5days) combined with serology testing for immunity (every 4 weeks). Clinical symptoms in positive participants were recorded using a 26-item, Likert-Scale-based scoring system. RESULT(S): During the study period, 85 subjects returned positive (cycle threshold (cT) <=30) or reactive (30<cT<40) PCR tests, of which 36 were players. The infection rate was consistent with that of the general population during the same time period. More than half of infected subjects were asymptomatic, and the remaining had only mild symptoms with no one requiring hospitalisation. Symptom severity was associated with lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, and no infection could be traced to training or matches. Of the 36 infected players, 15 presented positive serology during the study period. CONCLUSION(S): Football played outdoors involving close contact between athletes represents a limited risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness when preventive measures are in place.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

29,COVID-19 in Patients with Systemic Inflammatory Diseases: Impact on Disease Activity,,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic, an international emergency, raised concerns about the interaction of this infection and disease-modifying drugs used in the treatment of Systemic inflammatory diseases (SID). Understanding the relationship between COVID-19 and disease activity is crucial to adapt the treatment. Aim(s): The aim of our study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the disease activity of rheumatic diseases. Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study, including patients with SID (rheuma-toid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA)). Disease activity was evaluated during the last check-up before COVID-19 and within the period of 6 months after the infection. Activity scores were assessed with Disease Activity Score (DAS28) for RA and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) for SpA. Correlation and regression coefficients were used to evaluate associations among the variables. Results and Discussion: Totally, thirty-two patients were included; twenty followed for RA and twelve for axial SpA. The mean disease duration of the underlying rheumatic disease was 10.2 years (2-30). RA was seropositive and erosive in 61% and 31%, respectively. Seventeen patients were on csDMARDs: 14 were on Methotrexate and three patients were on Salazopyrine. Ten patients (31%) were treated with bDMARDs; Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors were used in eight cas-es. Rituximab and secukinumab were prescribed for one patient each. In 70%, COVID-19 was pauci-symptomatic. A severe form with a need for hospitalization was noted in 9%. Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, treatment with DMARDs was interrupted in all cases: when COVID-19 symptoms began in 82% and when PCR was positive in 18%. Both RA and axial SpA were not active after a mean period of 6 months after COVID-19 infection (p = 0.818 and p = 0.626, respectively). Conclusion(s): Although our patients interrupted their DMARDs, our study demonstrates that disease activity as assessed by ASDAS and DAS28 in SpA and RA remained unchanged after COVID-19.Copyright © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",Miledi S.; Bouzid S.; Fazaa A.; Sallemi M.; Bousaa H.; Abdelghani K.B.; Laatar A.,,1573-3971,/10.2174/1573397119666230116151541,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.2174%2f1573397119666230116151541,0,0,,123
36,COVID-19 in patients diagnosed with persistent tachypnea of infancy,,"Objective: Novel coronavirus has raised substantial concern for patients with chronic lung diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 in children with persistent tachypnea of infancy (PTI). Method(s): Children who were previously diagnosed with PTI and admitted for regular follow-up visits were assessed. Data on the history of having SARS-CoV-2 infection was collected. Result(s): Between January 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022, 62 patients with PTI (median age 3.7 years) were evaluated. Thirty-eight patients (61.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Fourteen (36.8%) of them had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and 24 (63.2%) were diagnosed by a positive serology test for specific antibodies connected with a history of close contact. Sixteen patients (42.1%) were asymptomatic, and 22 (57.9%) symptomatic. The most common symptoms were rhinorrhea or nasal congestion (77.3%), cough (72.7%), and sore throat (45.5%). According to NIH guidelines, 16 (42.1%) patients were classified as having mild disease, and in 3 (7.9%) children who had dyspnea, the moderate disease was recognized. Three children (7.9%) with increased dyspnea and oxygen demand required admission to the hospital. Follow-up performed in a median time of 6 months revealed that nearly all PTI patients after COVID-19 returned to their baseline status (78.9%); 4 children (10.5%) suffered from exacerbating symptoms of the chILD for one month. Surprisingly two (5.3%) children became completely asymptomatic after COVID-19.

150,COVID-19 infection among emergency department healthcare providers in a large tertiary academic medical center following the peak of the pandemic.,2021 Feb,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread through the US during the last few months exposing healthcare providers to possible infection. Here we report testing of emergency department (ED) healthcare providers (HCP) for exposure to COVID-19 through lateral flow point of care (POC) and lab-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RTq-PCR for evidence of acute infection. 138 ED HCP were tested between May 26th (approximately one month after the peak of COVID-19 first wave of cases) and June 14th. Enrolled ED HCP represented about 70% of the total ED HCP workforce during the study period. Subjects were tested with a POC COVID-19 antibody test, and standard ELISA performed by a university-based research lab. Subjects also provided a mid-turbinate swab and a saliva specimen for RTq-PCR. All subjects provided demographic information, past medical history, information about personal protective equipment (PPE) use, COVID-19 symptoms, as well as potential COVID-19 exposures during the previous 4 weeks, both in the ED, and outside the clinical setting. None of the HCP had positive RT-PCR results; 7 HCP (5%) had positive IgG for COVID-19; there was strong agreement between the lab-based ELISA (reference test) and the POC Ab test (P <= 0.0001). For the POC Ab test there were no false negatives and only one false positive among the 138 participants. There was no significant difference in demographic/ethnic variables, past medical history, hours worked in the ED, PPE use, or concerning exposures between seropositive and seronegative individuals. Moreover, there was no significant difference in reported symptoms between the two groups during the previous four weeks. The rate of COVID-19 seroconversion in our ED was 5% during the month following the pandemic's first wave.

27,A MASS OF COMPLICATIONS FROM AN UNEXPECTED UNDERLYING DIAGNOSIS IN AN IMMUNOCOMPETENT PATIENT,,"CASE: A 37-year-old man with history of obesity presented to the hospital with 2 weeks of progressive odynophagia, dysphagia, productive cough, and a new right submandibular mass that was initially soft and tender but became firm and painless. He endorsed weight loss of 127 pounds in 8 months, attributed to dietary modifications. He denied, dyspnea, fever, and night sweats. Vitals were normal other than tachycardia to 109. Physical exam revealed a palpable mass in the right submandibular region, diffuse submandibular lymphadenopathy, and occasional rhonchi. Labs were notable for strep DNA positivity on pharyngeal swab. CBC and CMP were normal. Influenza, COVID-19, RSV, and mono testing was negative. CT scan of the neck and chest showed mass-like fullness in the right Peri tonsillar region with loss of the parapharyngeal fat and encasement and narrowing of the right internal and external carotid arteries, submandibular lymphadenopathy, enlarged hilar lymph nodes, and a mass-like consolidation in the superior segment lower lobe of the left lung. He received IV Unasyn, Vancomycin, and dexamethasone without benefit. His course was complicated by multiple syncopal, hypotensive, and bradycardic episodes attributed to impingement of the carotid sinus by the mass. Laryngoscopy showed severe airway narrowing, resulting in awake tracheostomy. He then developed Serratia and Klebsiella bacteremia leading to MICU transfer for fluids, pressors, and IV antibiotics. Multiple biopsies of the nasopharyngeal mucosa were read as reactive tissue. PET/CT imaging was pursued given a high concern for malignancy and showed FDG avid pharyngeal and right parapharyngeal soft tissue thickening, FDG avid consolidation in the left lung, hypermetabolic left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and FDG uptake throughout the bone marrow and spleen. Transbronchial biopsy revealed granulomas and histoplasma antibody titer of 1:64. He was treated for disseminated histoplasmosis with ambisome. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Histoplasmosis is caused by the endemic mycosis, Histoplasma capsulatum. It can be found anywhere in the United States but is most prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Risk factors for disseminated infection include primary immunodeficiencies, AIDS, extreme ages, and immunosuppressive drugs. Construction, farming, and spelunking have also been associated with an increased risk for infection, as the mold grows best in soils with a high nitrogen content. Approximately 90% of exposed individuals will remain asymptomatic or have self-limited symptoms. Clinical manifestations are widely variable and nonspecific. This case demonstrates the ability of H. capsulatum to cause life-threatening symptoms, even in an immunocompetent patient. CONCLUSION(S): Disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered in a patient with systemic symptoms regardless of immune status, especially in highly endemic areas. Prompt diagnosis is important for the avoidance of life-threatening complications.",Roberts K.; Presti R.,,1525-1497,/10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed26&DO=10.1007%2fs11606-023-08226-z,0,0,,127
4,High Rate of Asymptomatic Carriage Associated with Variant Strain Omicron,,"The early widespread dissemination of Omicron indicates the urgent need to better understand the transmission dynamics of this variant, including asymptomatic spread among immunocompetent and immunosuppressed populations. In early December 2021, the Ubuntu clinical trial, designed to evaluate efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) among persons living with HIV (PLWH), began enrolling participants. Nasal swabs are routinely obtained at the initial vaccination visit, which requires participants to be clinically well to receive their initial jab. Of the initial 230 participants enrolled between December 2 and December 17, 2021, 71 (31%) were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2: all of whom were subsequently confirmed by S gene dropout to be Omicron; 48% of the tested samples had cycle threshold (CT) values <25 and 18% less than 20, indicative of high titers of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic carriage rates were similar in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative persons (27% respectively). These data are in stark contrast to COVID-19 vaccine studies conducted pre-Omicron, where the SARSCoV-2 PCR positivity rate at the first vaccination visit ranged from <1%-2.4%, including a cohort of over 1,200 PLWH largely enrolled in South Africa during the Beta outbreak. We also evaluated asymptomatic carriage in a sub study of the Sisonke vaccine trial conducted in South African health care workers, which indicated 2.6% asymptomatic carriage during the Beta and Delta outbreaks and subsequently rose to 16% in both PLWH and PHLWH during the Omicron period.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

59,UNUSUAL CASE OF ANTI-SYNTHETASE SYNDROME CORRELATED WITH EXPOSURE TO COVID-19 INFECTION OR VACCINE,,"SESSION TITLE: Systemic Disease with Diffuse Lung Symptoms Case Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Since its first detection at Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus 2019) has engulfed the world with more than 100 million cases and manifestations of COVID19 have been evolving over time. Various post COVID19 syndromes are being recognized. Reactive arthritis, connective tissue disorders such as myositis and pulmonary complications have been correlated with exposure to COVID infection. We describe the case of antisynthetase syndrome in a patient correlated with exposure to COVID infection or vaccine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68 year old female with history of hypertension and exposure to COVID infection in the family member, presented with 2-3 months worsening generalized body ache/pain started 2 weeks after receiving second dose of mRNA vaccine. Patient also reported dyspnea and leg swelling for 1 month. Upon presentation, she was placed on 4 liter oxygen via nasal cannula. Chest x-ray concerning for infiltrates, possibly COVID. CT chest no pulmonary embolism but evidence of pneumonia superimposed on chronic appearing bronchiectasis. Flu and Covid testing were negative. Patient was started on IV antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia. Labs showed elevated ESR, CRP and CK level. No fever, weakness, mechanics hands, rash or Raynaud's phenomenon. Infectious work up remained negative. No lymphadenopathy on CT chest to suggest sarcoid. ACE level normal. ANA and anti aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibody positive but other ENA were negative. HMG-COA ab negative. MPO/PR3 neg. Echocardiogram was unremarkable. Work up was suggestive of Anti synthetase syndrome with interstitial lung disease(ILD), a form of dermatomyositis. Patient was started on intravenous steroid with good improvement in symptoms and later transitioned to oral prednisone. Patient was discharged on minimal home oxygen with plan to start immunosuppressive medications. DISCUSSION: We are unsure if our patient had COVID19 infection since COVID testings were negative (antigen, antibody and nucleic acid detection ). The likelihood of autoimmune and rheumatic diseases in COVID19 survivors is a big issue. COVID19 infection may unmask previously undiagnosed rheumatic conditions and precipitate de novo disease, both of which may persist after resolution of the initial infection. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of early treatment with initial doses at 1mg/kg of the ideal body weight. In an effort to reduce steroid related side effects, other immunosuppressive agents should be considered at the outset of therapy, particularly when treating anti-synthetase syndrome with manifestations of ILD. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with anti-synthetase syndrome with ILD could have correlation with exposure to COVID infection or vaccination, and are steroid responsive. It is likely that clinical improvement may result from prompt suppression of inflammatory systemic response by corticosteroid. Reference #1: 1. Ahmed S, Zimba O, Gasparyan AY.

119,High Rate of Asymptomatic Carriage Associated with Variant Strain Omicron.,2022 Jan 14,"The early widespread dissemination of Omicron indicates the urgent need to better understand the transmission dynamics of this variant, including asymptomatic spread among immunocompetent and immunosuppressed populations. In early December 2021, the Ubuntu clinical trial, designed to evaluate efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) among persons living with HIV (PLWH), began enrolling participants. Nasal swabs are routinely obtained at the initial vaccination visit, which requires participants to be clinically well to receive their initial jab. Of the initial 230 participants enrolled between December 2 and December 17, 2021, 71 (31%) were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2: all of whom were subsequently confirmed by S gene dropout to be Omicron; 48% of the tested samples had cycle threshold (CT) values <25 and 18% less than 20, indicative of high titers of asymptomatic shedding. Asymptomatic carriage rates were similar in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative persons (27% respectively). These data are in stark contrast to COVID-19 vaccine studies conducted pre-Omicron, where the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate at the first vaccination visit ranged from <1%-2.4%, including a cohort of over 1,200 PLWH largely enrolled in South Africa during the Beta outbreak.

61,POST-COVID-19 VACCINE RELAPSE OF GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME (GBS) FOLLOWING AN ANTECEDENT PARAINFECTIOUS COVID-19-RELATED GBS: A CASE REPORT,,"We report on a patient who presented with para-infectious COVID- 19-related, GD1b IgM-seropositive Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and, subsequently, post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS, with antibody polyreactivity of ganglioside IgM. A 57-year-old man was admitted to our Neurology Department with fever, arthromyalgia, and mixed neurological symptoms. Molecular test for SARS-CoV-2, CSF analysis, electrophysiological and serological studies were performed. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed. The patient developed rightside seventh cranial nerve palsy, distal paresthesias in the four limbs, flaccid tetraparesis and autonomic dysfunction, with access to ICU care. CSF analysis (albuminocytological dissociation) and electrophysiological studies supported the diagnosis of GBS. GD1b IgM seropositivity was found. An IVIg course prompted almost complete recovery. Six months later, the patient received the first dose of Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine. Five days later, he developed feet hypoesthesia, distal lower limb weakness and ataxic gait. GBS diagnosis was confirmed by CSF and electrophysiological studies. Seropositivity for GM3/4, GD1a/b, GT1b IgM was detected. An IVIg course prompted complete recovery. COVID-19 vaccination in patients with previous para-/post-COVID- 19 GBS, especially whether they result seropositive for ganglioside antibodies, deserves reappraisal. Molecular mimicry and anti-idiotype antibodies might have contributed to the vaccine-related GBS. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that can have infectious episodes and vaccinations as triggers. The mass vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 expectedly yielded several cases of post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS, which prompted the search for a possible causal link. This is difficult to demonstrate without mechanistic evidence, as temporal association does not imply causation. However, an epidemiological investigation, calculating the observed-to-expected ratio of post-vaccine GBS, raised potential safety concern for GBS following receipt of Ad26. COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine. Besides, among the rare neurological complications of COVID-19 vaccines, the mRNA vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 was found to increase the risk of GBS, a finding confirmed in a second cohort. The main limitations of these studies include the passive reporting systems and presumptive case definition biases. Unusual adverse events, such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, and IgA vasculitis also suggest potential links with COVID-19 vaccines. However, the demonstration of such links is still lacking. We report on a patient with post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS, who had previously had a COVID-19-related GBS, thus suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection could have triggered, in a genetically predisposed subject, peripheral nerve-specific autoimmunity. The study obtained ethical approval and patient's signed informed consent.",Bellucci M.; Germano F.; Grisanti S.; Castellano C.; Tazza F.; Mobilia E.M.; Visigalli D.; Novi G.; Rossi S.; Durando P.; Cabona C.; Schenone A.; Franciotta D.; Benedetti L.,,1529-8027,/10.1111/jns.12496,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fjns.12496,0,0,,131
43,CASE REPORT: POST-COVID-19 VACCINE RECURRENCE OF GUILLAINBARRE SYNDROME (GBS) FOLLOWING AN ANTECEDENT PARAINFECTIOUS COVID-19-RELATED GBS,,"Objectives: We report on a unique combination of post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS that occurred months after a para-infectious COVID-19-related GBS. Material(s) and Method(s): A 57-year-old man was admitted to our Neurology Department with fever, arthromyalgia, and mixed neurological symptoms. Molecular test for SARS-CoV-2, CSF analysis, electrophysiological and serological studies were performed. Result(s): Nasopharyngeal swab PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed. The patient developed rightside seventh cranial nerve palsy, distal paresthesias in the four limbs, flaccid tetraparesis and autonomic dysfunction, with access to ICU care. CSF analysis (albuminocytological dissociation) and electrophysiological studies supported the diagnosis of GBS. GD1b IgM seropositivity was found. An IVIg course prompted almost complete recovery. Six months later, the patient received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Five days later, he developed feet hypoesthesia, distal lower limb weakness and ataxic gait. GBS diagnosis was confirmed by CSF and electrophysiological studies. Seropositivity for GM3/4, GD1a/b, GT1b IgM was detected. An IVIg course prompted complete recovery. Discussion(s): Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that can have infectious episodes and vaccinations as triggers. The mass vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 yielded several cases of post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS, which prompted the search for a possible causal link. This is difficult to demonstrate, as temporal association does not imply causation. However, an epidemiological investigation, calculating the observed-to-expected ratio of postvaccine GBS, raised potential safety concern for GBS following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination in patients with previous para-/post-COVID-19 GBS, especially whether they result seropositive for ganglioside antibodies, deserves reappraisal. In our patient, post-COVID-19 vaccine GBS was characterized by a so far never reported combination of IgM to GD1b and to other disialosyl gangliosides, which might reasonably be a result of molecular mimicry and hyper-stimulation of the immune system. Furthermore, anti-idiotype antibodies of the IgM class, might have contributed to autoimmunemediated phenomena initiated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reignited by the vaccine. Our case should be contextualized as an extremely rare event but warns about GBS recurrence after COVID-19 vaccination and suggests that seropositivity for ganglioside antibodies could be a marker of this risk in patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2- associated GBS. Conclusion(s): This case adds to other previously reported observations suggesting a possible causal link between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS. Molecular mimicry and anti-idiotype antibodies might be the underlying mechanisms. Future COVID-19 vaccinations/revaccinations in patients with previous para-/post-COVID-19 GBS, especially whether seropositive for ganglioside antibodies, deserves a reappraisal.",Bellucci M.; Germano F.; Grisanti S.; Castellano C.; Tazza F.; Mobilia E.; Visigalli D.; Novi G.; Rossi S.; Durando P.; Cabona C.; Schenone A.; Franciotta D.; Benedetti L.,,1590-3478,/10.1007/s10072-022-06531-9,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1007%2fs10072-022-06531-9,0,0,,132
21,"Associations of COVID-19 symptoms with omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.5, host status, and clinical outcomes in Japan: a registry-based observational study",,"Background: Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, coupled with the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, have modified COVID-19 clinical manifestations. We aimed to characterise the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 individuals in omicron BA.2 and BA.5 Japanese pandemic periods to identify omicron and subvariant associations between symptoms, immune status, and clinical outcomes. Method(s): In this registry-based observational study, individuals registered in Sapporo's web-based COVID-19 information system entered 12 pre-selected symptoms, days since symptom onset, vaccination history, SARS-CoV-2 infection history, and background. Eligibility criteria included symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR or antigen test), and individuals who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 but developed new symptoms after a household member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Symptom prevalence, variables associated with symptoms, and symptoms associated with progression to severe disease were analysed. Finding(s): Data were collected and analysed between April 25 and Sept 25, 2022. For 157 861 omicron-infected symptomatic individuals, cough was the most common symptom (99 032 [62.7%] patients), followed by sore throat (95 838 [60.7%] patients), nasal discharge (69 968 [44.3%] patients), and fever (61 218 [38.8%] patients). Omicron BA.5 infection was associated with a higher prevalence of systemic symptoms than BA.2 in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for fever: 2.18 [95% CI 2.12-2.25]). Omicron breakthrough-infected individuals with three or more vaccinations or previous infection were less likely to exhibit systemic symptoms (fever 0.50 [0.49-0.51]), but more likely to exhibit upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat 1.33 [1.29-1.36]; nasal discharge 1.84 [1.80-1.89]). Infected older individuals (>=65 years) had lower odds for all symptoms. However, when symptoms were manifest, systemic symptoms were associated with increased odds for severe disease (dyspnoea 3.01 [1.84-4.91]; fever 2.93 [1.89-4.52]), whereas upper respiratory symptoms were associated with decreased odds (sore throat 0.38 [0.24-0.63]; nasal discharge 0.48 [0.28-0.81]). Interpretation(s): Host immunological status, omicron subvariant, and age were associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. BA.5 produced a higher systemic symptom prevalence than BA.2. Vaccination and previous infection reduced systemic symptom prevalence and improved outcomes but increased upper respiratory tract symptom prevalence. Systemic, but not upper respiratory, symptoms in older people heralded severe disease. Our findings could serve as a practical guide to use COVID-19 symptoms to appropriately modify health-care strategies and predict clinical outcomes for older patients with omicron infections.

89,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 related hospitalization among persons living with HIV (PLWHs),,"Purpose: Aim of this study was to compare characteristics at presentation and clinical outcomes of persons living with HIV (PLWH) versus HIV-negative patients (non-PLWH) hospitalized with COVID-19. Method(s): Adult patients with SARS-CoV- 2 infection (positive RT-PCR from nasal/oropharyngeal swab or positive serology) admitted at our Institute were included. Primary endpoint: time to invasive ventilation/death. Secondary endpoints: time to ventilation/death, time to symptoms resolution (resolution of fever/weaning from oxygen). In order to control for measured confounders, Cox regression model was used. Result(s): 1647 hospitalized patients were included in the analysis (43 [2.6%] PLWH, 1604 non-PLWH) (Table 1). PLWH were mostly male (74%), slightly younger (55 vs 61 years, P = 0.03) than non-PLWH, less likely with pneumonia (70% vs 90%, P < 0.001) and with PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg at admission (18% vs 38%, P = 0.011). Symptoms at presentation were similar in the two groups apart from headache, more frequent in PLWH (P = 0.001). Among PLWH, nadir CD4 was 185 (75-322) cells/mm, CD4 at COVID-19 diagnosis 272 (127-468), 77% had HIV-RNA< 50 copies/ml. Characteristics of PLWH not virologically suppressed are shown in Table 2. The cumulative probability of invasive mechanical ventilation/ death at day 15 was 4.7% (95%CI 1.2-17.3) in PLWH versus 18.9% (16.9-21.1) in non-PLWH (P = 0.023) (Figure 1A). The cumulative probability of non-invasive/ invasive ventilation/death at day-15 was 20.9% (11.5-36.4) in PLWH versus 37.6% (35.1-40.2) in non-PLWH (P = 0.044) (Figure 1B). Following adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities, PaO2/FiO2 and pneumonia at admission, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of invasive mechanical ventilation/death of PLWH was 0.49 (95% CI 0.12-1.96, P = 0.310) versus non-PLWH; the aHR of non-invasive/ invasive ventilation/ death of PLWH was 1.03 (95% CI 0.53-2.00, P = 0.926). The probability of symptoms resolution at day 15 (Figure 1C) was similar in the two groups (aHR 0.92;0.63-1.96; P = 0.691).

101,Gasping for a diagnosis-a case of mda-5 positive dermatomyositis-related interstitial lung disease,,"Introduction The presence of antibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) is an ominous marker that is associated with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM). Early identification along with consideration of aggressive immunomodulation with monitoring for referral for lung transplantation evaluation is critical for patient outcomes. Here, we describe the diagnostic evaluation for a patient presenting with productive cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion, eventually found to have MDA-5 positive dermatomyositis-related ILD. Description of the case A 37-year-old male with history of THC vape exposure presented with an acute febrile respiratory illness prior to the COVID pandemic. He was found on high-resolution CT imaging of his chest to have peripheral predominant bilateral ground glass opacities and underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy of the right lower lobe, with pathology demonstrating organizing pneumonia. Infectious studies from a subsequent bronchalveolar lavage demonstrated no evidence of infection, and the patient was initiated on pulse steroids for progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ICU admission and high flow nasal cannula. Initial concern at this juncture was for e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) because his initial infectious and autoimmune panels were negative, with concern for early progression to fibrosis. However, a subsequent extended myositis panel revealed positivity for MDA-5 antibodies. Upon completion of his pulse steroids, he was transitioned to mycophenolate mofetil with intermittent intravenous immunoglobulins targeting for cutaneous dermatomyositis manifestation in coordination with rheumatology. With titration of his immunosuppression, he was able to wean off supplemental oxygen therapy. He remains closely monitored by pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk tests, and imaging. Discussion of the novelty and importance of the case This case demonstrates the complexity of diagnosis of rapidly progressive interstitial lung diseases, with the need for multidisciplinary management for aggressive disease phenotypes. Early, aggressive immunomodulation in coordination with rheumatology achieved disease stability for this patient and has successfully delayed need for lung transplantation evaluation.",Yuen A.D.; Betancourt J.; Eng K.,,1535-4970,/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2021.203.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2039,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1164%2fajrccm-conference.2021.203.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2039,0,0,,137
102,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19-related hospitalization among plwh,,"Background: There is conflicting evidence on how HIV influences COVID19 infection. Aim of this study was to compare characteristics at presentation and clinical outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH) versus HIV negative patients (non-PLWH) hospitalized with COVID-19. Method(s): Patients >=18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as positive RT-PCR from nasal/oropharyngeal swab or positive serology, admitted at L. Spallanzani Institute (Italy) were included. Primary endpoint: time to invasive ventilation/death. Secondary endpoints: time to ventilation/death, time to symptoms resolution (resolution of fever or waning from oxygen). In order to control for measured confounders, Cox regression model was used. Result(s): A total of 905 hospitalized patients were included in the analysis (22 [2.4%] PLWH, 883 non-PLWH): 65% males, 66% with at least one comorbidity, median PaO2/FiO2 at admission 343 mmHg (260-405). PLWH were slightly younger (56 vs 62 years, p=0.057), less likely with pneumonia (59% vs 87%, p<0.001) and with PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg at admission (10% vs 31%, p=0.088), with less alterations in lymphocytes (1505 cells/mm vs 1170, p=0.025) and D-dimer (473 ng/mL vs 661, p=0.015) compared with non-PLWH. Symptoms at presentation were similar in the two groups apart from headache and myalgia that were more frequent in PLWH (both p<0.001). Among PLWH, nadir CD4 was 80 (33-284) cells/mul, CD4 at COVID19 diagnosis 350 cells/mul (138-515), all of them were on antiretroviral therapy and 94% had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The cumulative probability of invasive ventilation/death at day 14 was 9.1% (95% CI 2.4-31.7) in PLWH versus 14.7% (12.3-17.6) in non-PLWH (p=0.492). The cumulative probability of non-invasive or invasive ventilation/ death at day 14 was 14.3% (4.8-38.0) in PLWH versus 24.4% (21.4-27.8) in non-PLWH (p=0.372). Following adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities, PaO2/FiO2 and pneumonia at admission, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of mechanical ventilation/death of PLWH was 0.95 (95% CI 0.13-6.98, p=0.958) versus non-PLWH; similarly, aHR of non-invasive or invasive ventilation/death of PLWH was 1.05 (95% CI 0.26-4.28, p=0.947). The probability of symptoms resolution at day 14 was similar in the two groups (aHR 1.16; 0.65-2.09; p=0.614). Conclusion(s): A less severe presentation and no difference in clinical outcomes with Covid-19 even in the adjusted models were observed in PLWH compared to non-PLWH, but further investigations are warranted due to the small sample size of HIV+ population.

30,Utilization of COVID-19 allografts without transmission to recipients in liver transplantation,,"Background: The utilization of COVID-19 positive donors has expanded the donor pool for liver and kidney transplantation in the United States since initiation of COVID allograft utilization protocols in 2020 and 2021. Utilization of these allografts has been demonstrated to be a safe practice and to reduce waitlist mortality; however, the transmission rate of COVID-19 from these allografts has not been well documented. Method(s): In August 2021, an institutional COVID-19 positive serology donor protocol was implemented for liver and kidney transplants. Post-reperfusion liver biopsies were obtained intra-operatively to evaluate for COVID-19 RNA in the donor allografts. Post-operative management of recipients and immunosuppression were similar to standard protocols. All recipients were vaccinated per institutional protocol. Primary endpoint evaluated was transmission of COVID-19 to donors via nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab on post-operative day 7. Result(s): 38 vaccinated recipients underwent transplantation with 17 livers, 3 liver-kidneys (SLK), and 18 kidneys from 33 COVID-19 positive deceased donors between August 2021 and April 2022. 90.9% of donors were asymptomatic at time of donation. On post-reperfusion allograft biopsies, COVID-19 RNA was found in only 10% (2/20) of samples. All recipients were COVID-19 negative on post-operative day 7 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, showing a 0% transmission rate of COVID-19 from the positive allografts. Respiratory complications were noted in 13% of the recipients; however, none were related to COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The safety of using COVID-19 allografts has been demonstrated in the literature and is again supported by this study which demonstrates no cases of clinically relevant or PCR-detectable transmission of COVID-19 from the positive allografts to recipients, despite 10% of allografts having COVID-19 RNA present on post-reperfusion biopsy. Further use of this underutilized donor source can continue to expand the donor pool in the US and decrease waitlist mortality.Copyright © 2023",Whitrock J.; Quillin R.; Delman A.; Price A.; Sharma D.; Wang J.; Lemon K.; Chang A.; Silski L.; Cuffy M.; Shah S.,,1365-182X,/10.1016/j.hpb.2023.05.094,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.hpb.2023.05.094,0,0,,140

22,Polymerase chain reaction-positivity and predictors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among diagnosed cases' in North West Ethiopia,,"Background: The lack of sophisticated diagnosing equipment for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the incidence of variant types of COVID-19 underestimates the morbidity and mortality patterns of this pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to estimate seropositive and confirmatory predictors for COVID-19 suspected and tested cases through polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two diagnosing. Method(s): A facility-based descriptive cross-sectional study was employed among COVID-19 suspected cases from January 2, 2022, to June 9, 2022. The data were collected both using a structured interviewees and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. The nasal swab (NS) was analyzed in the laboratory for RNA detection of the virus using PCR. The collected data were entered into Epi Data version 4.2 and then exported to STATA (SE) version R-14 software for further analysis. multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associated risk. Result(s): A total of 285 suspected cases have participated in this study. The overall mean (+/-SD) age of the participants was 37.5 (+/-18.5) years. The majority, 174 (61.1%) of the tested groups were symptomatic when diagnosed. The positivity of RT-PCR for suspected and COVID-19 diagnosed cases were confirmed in 62/285 (21.75%). In multivariable analysis, they were aged 26-50 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-10.75), had comorbidity (AOR = 5.8; 95% CI = 2.1-12.2), and cigarette smokers (AOR = 13.5; 95% CI = 5.3-36.6) were significantly associated with developing COVID-19 infection. Conclusion(s): More than two in every nine suspected cases were positive RT-PCR tests, and the infectivity of COVID-19 was significantly associated with age 25-50 years, comorbidities, and cigarette smoking. The deployment of high-quality diagnostic kits like RT-PCR is crucial for the early detection and risk stratification of suspected cases.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

However, its sensitivity might be suboptimal. The current study aims to investigate predictive factors for false-negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in CoViD-19 patients. Additionally, the specificity and sensitivity of RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab, serology and chest computerized-tomography (CCT) as a screening tool for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 were investigated. Method(s): Medical records of patients admitted at the university hospital UZ Brussel during the CoViD-19 epidemic were reviewed. A group of CoViD-19 patients with false-negative RT-PCR was identified through scrupulous examination of medical records. Serological testing was performed through chemiluminescent microparticle assay. Result(s): Eighteen CoViD-19 patients with 'false negative' RT-PCR were identified and compared to 51 'true positives'. Logistic regression for prediction of 'false negative' RT-PCR found significantly higher serology results at hospitalization and more intensive care unit admission in the group with false-negative testing. In a cohort of 228 patients, the sensitivity of RT-PCR for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 was 85%. The sensitivity of serology was 86% and its specificity 92%. Chest computerized-tomography (CCT) showed a sensitivity of 93%, its specificity was 62%. By combining RT-PCR and serology results any 'false negative' could be excluded. Conclusion(s): In this cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR and serology for the diagnosis of CoViD-19 were high and comparable. CCT had the highest sensitivity and confirmed its efficacy as a screening tool.

79,Reintroduction of elective cardiac interventions in the era of COVID-19: The Barts experience,,"Background The response to COVID-19 has required cancellation of all but the most urgent procedures; there is therefore a need for the reintroduction of a safe elective pathway. Methods This was a study of a pilot pathway performed at Barts Heart Centre for the admission of patients requiring elective coronary and structural procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020). All patients on coronary and structural waiting lists were screened for procedural indications, urgency and adverse features for COVID-19 prognosis and discussed at dedicated multidisciplinary teams. Dedicated admission pathways involving preadmission isolation, additional consent, COVID-19 PCR testing and dedicated clean areas were used. Results 143 patients (101 coronary and 42 structural) underwent procedures (coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, transcatheter aortic valve intervention and MitralClip) during the study period. The average age was 68.2; 74% were male; and over 93% had one or more moderate COVID-19 risk factors. All patients were COVID-19 PCR negative on admission with (8.1%) COVID-19 antibody positive (swab negative). All procedures were performed successfully with low rates of procedural complications (9.8%). At 2-week follow-up, no patients had symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 infection with significant improvements in quality if life and symptoms. Conclusion We demonstrated that patients undergoing coronary and structural procedures can be safely admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no patients contracting COVID-19 during their admission. Reassuringly, patients reflective of typical practice, that is, those at moderate or higher risk, were treated successfully. This pilot provides important information applicable to other settings, specialties and areas to reintroduce services safely.Copyright © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s).

37,Maternal COVID-19 infection and associated factors: A cross-sectional study,,"Background Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, several studies have been conducted to examine associated factors. However, few studies have focused on pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 infection among pregnant women at the Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital and Women and Newborn Hospital of the University Teaching Hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between March and July 2021. Women were recruited as they presented for antenatal care. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire to capture variables of interest (socio-demographic, clinical and obstetric). COVID-19 diagnosis was made using a nasopharyngeal swab by PCR test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for confounding and calculate the odds ratios for each explanatory variable and respective 95% confidence intervals. Results The study enrolled 352 participants with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 30.1 years (5.6). One hundred thirty of 352 (36.9%; 95% CI: 31.9 to 42.2) participants had a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. At univariable analysis, factors associated with COVID-19 were increased gestational age, education status and maternal HIV serostatus. Women with a secondary level of education were less likely to have COVID-19 infection than those with a primary level of education (AOR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09-0.63). On the other hand, a one-week increase in gestational age was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.06). Conclusion The results showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women was 36.9% and was associated with increased gestational age and a lower level of education. To mitigate adverse maternal outcomes, there is a need to screen for COVID-19 strictly and broadly monitor prenatal women presenting for healthcare.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

97,COVID or not COVID,,"Background and Aims: COVID-19 infection has been associated with various neurological features. We present an interesting case of a patient with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and a trio of neurological sequelae (subarachnoid haemorrhage, infarcts and microhaemorrhages) but with no serological evidence of COVID-19. Method(s): A 39-year-old female presented with type 1 respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation within 48 hours of admission. She reported mild symptoms of COVID-19 a month prior to admission. Her chest radiograph was highly suggestive of COVID-19 and a CT Pulmonary Angiogram revealed multiple small emboli. She was inappropriate off sedation hence a CT head was performed, which showed a subtle subarachnoid haemorrhage. A subsequent MRI head performed one month later showed frontal lobe infarcts and multiple microhaemorrhages. A year on, the patient reported ongoing long-term issues with memory and concentration. Of note, the patient had two negative COVID-19 swab tests during the admission and SARS-COV2 antibodies were not detected one month after discharge. Result(s): The occurrence of both haemorrhage and infarcts posed an interesting clinical dilemma regarding the initiation of anticoagulation. Despite her negative serology, her MRI was typical of patients with COVID-19. Given her ongoing cognitive impairment, it is possible that the microhaemorrhages are responsible for the ""Brain-fog"" that COVID survivors describe. Conclusion(s): This is a case of probable COVID-19 with intracranial and pulmonary infarcts, as well as subarachnoid and microhaemorrhages. The neuroradiological findings, particularly microhaemorrhages, may have contributed to long-term cognitive impairment. The importance of prompt serological testing would have helped in determining COVID status.",Kanagaratnam M.; Mothojakan N.; St Aimee L.; Siddiqui S.S.; Kee Y.-Y.K.,,2396-9881,/10.1177/23969873211034932,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1177%2f23969873211034932,0,0,,149

31,COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection among people living with HIV in the US: the MACS/WIHS combined cohort study,,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection among People Living With HIV (PLWH) is not well-described. Objective(s): To study COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based swab testing among participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Method(s): A telephone survey was collected April-June 30, 2020. Symptom and testing prevalence were explored. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Result(s): The survey was completed by 3411 participants, including 2078 (61%) PLWH and 1333 HIV-seronegative (SN) participants from across the US. Thirteen percent (n = 441) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.4% of PLWH vs 12.2% of SN). Among those tested, positivity was higher in PLWH than SN (11.2% vs 6.1%, p = 0.08). Reasons for not being tested included testing not being available (30% of participants) and not knowing where to get tested (16% of participants). Most symptoms reported since January 2020 were similar in PLWH and SN, including headache (23% vs. 24%), myalgias (19% vs 18%), shortness of breath (14% vs 13%), chills (12% vs 10%), fever (6% vs 6%) and loss of taste or smell (6% vs 7%). Among PLWH who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 DNA, the most common symptoms were headache (71%), myalgia (68%), cough (68%) and chills (65%). In multivariable analysis among those tested, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 positivity were higher among PLWH than SN (aOR = 2.22 95%CI = 01.01-4.85, p = 0.046) and among those living with others versus living alone (aOR = 2.95 95%CI = 1.18-7.40).

33,REACTOGENICITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AFTER mRNA-1273 VACCINE IN UBUNTU STUDY,,"Background: The tolerability of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines among people living with HIV (PLWH) has been understudied in vaccine trials. CoVPN 3008 (Ubuntu) is the largest multicenter Phase 3 efficacy trial of mRNA vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa. Method(s): We enrolled adults age >=18 years living with HIV or another comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Previously vaccinated individuals were excluded. Baseline testing included HIV, CD4 count and HIV viral load (VL) (if HIV+), anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). All participants receive vaccinations at months 0 and 6, and SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals also receive vaccination at month 1. This analysis includes mRNA-1273 vaccinations at months 0 and 1. Reactogenicity (solicited adverse events [AEs]) was assessed among a representative subset of participants (Safety Subset, SS) for 7 days post-vaccination. Baseline characteristics associated with moderate/severe reactogenicity events were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): 14002 participants were enrolled in the trial (1510 into the SS) at 46 sites from 2 Dec 2021 to 9 Sep 2022. At baseline in the SS, 71% (1065) were female, median age 38 years (IQR 32-46), and median BMI 25.0 (IQR 20.7-30.2). 73% (1108) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, and 8.7% (131) had a positive nasal NAAT swab. 16% (197) had a history of tuberculosis. 84% (1267) were PLWH, with median CD4 count of 614 cells/muL (IQR 414-861); 7.8% had CD4 count < 200. 21% (238) had detectable HIV VL (>=50 copies/mL), with median VL 1660 (IQR 182-23932). 14% (172/1262) and 12% (64/542) of PLWH reported moderate/severe reactogenicity after the 1st and 2nd vaccination (Figure), with no hospitalizations. Female PLWH and CD4 count >500 had 35% (p=0.03) and 44% (p=0.04) increased odds of moderate/severe reactogenicity, respectively. Other baseline characteristics were not associated with the odds of reporting moderate/severe reactogenicity among PLWH after 1st vaccination. Similar trends were seen after the 2nd vaccination, but none reached statistical significance. In multivariate models, female sex remained associated with increased odds of moderate/severe reactogenicity after the 2nd vaccination. Conclusion(s): Similar to observations in HIV-negative populations, mRNA-1273 was well tolerated by PLWH with more reactogenicity in females. Impaired inflammatory responses among participants with CD4 counts < 500 cell/muL may explain less moderate/severe reactions.",Tapley A.; Andriesen J.; Huang Y.; Takalani A.; Mabilane B.; Villaran M.V.; Samandari T.; Dadabhai S.; Bekker L.-G.; Yacovone M.; Hudson A.; Corey L.; Gray G.E.; Kotze P.; Garrett N.,,2161-5853,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641190926,0,0,,155
