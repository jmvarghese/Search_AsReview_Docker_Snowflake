Deficient SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity during inflammatory bowel disease.,Feb 2025,"Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) undergoing immunosuppressive therapies face heightened susceptibility to severe COVID-19. An in-depth understanding of systemic inflammation and cellular immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and breakthrough infections (BTI) is required for optimizing vaccine strategies in this population. While the prevalence of high serological responders post- third COVID-19 vaccine dose was lower, and the antibody waning was higher in IBD patients than in healthy donors (HD), IBD patients showed an increase in anti-RBD Wild Type IgG levels and cross-reactive Spike -specific memory B cells following BTI. However, there was no significant enhancement in cellular immune responses against anti-SARS-CoV-2 post-BTI, with responses instead characterized by activation of SARS-CoV-2 specific and also bystander CD8 T cells. These results suggest a complex interaction between chronic inflammation in IBD and the generation of new immune responses, highlighting the need for tailored vaccine regimens and anti-inflammatory therapies to boost cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Alirezaylavasani, Amin; Egner, Ingrid Marie; Dahl, Børresdatter; Chopra, Adity; de Matos Kasahara, Taissa; Goll, Guro Løvik; Jahnsen, Jørgen; Grødeland, Gunnveig; Vaage, John Torgils; Lund-Johansen, Fridtjof; Holter, Jan Cato; Halvorsen, Bente; Jørgensen, Kristin Kaasen; Munthe, Ludvig A; Kared, Hassen","Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",1521-7035,10.1016/j.clim.2024.110404,39645159,"Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; KG Jebsen Centre for B cell Malignancies, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway; Precision Immunotherapy Alliance, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; KG Jebsen Centre for B cell Malignancies, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway; Precision Immunotherapy Alliance, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Precision Immunotherapy Alliance, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; ImmunoLingo Convergence Center, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Division of Rheumatology and Research, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Health and Society, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Gastroenterology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Precision Immunotherapy Alliance, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; ImmunoLingo Convergence Center, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Microbiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Gastroenterology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; KG Jebsen Centre for B cell Malignancies, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway; Precision Immunotherapy Alliance, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

Altered plasma levels of the SARS-CoV-2-related proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in patients with Crohn's disease.,Dec 2024,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infects cells through the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the protease TMPRSS2 for the priming of viral spike protein. Thus, changes in these key proteins due to chronic conditions can increase risk for SARS-CoV2 infection; but significance of changes may differ is these changes correspond to full-length species or proteolytic fragments. Here, we determined that full-length ACE2 decreased in the plasma of uninfected Crohn's disease (CD) patients before treatment onset compared to controls. TMPRSS2 is mostly presented in plasma as full-length species and as an active peptidase fragment, but also as a prodomain fragment, which is the unique species remarkably decreased in plasma from CD patients. Patients treated with the anti-TNFα adalimumab showed recovery in ACE2 levels, while those treated with infliximab, or with the anti-IL-12/23 ustekinumab, still displayed a decrease in full-length species, as well as in cleaved fragments. Patients treated with azathioprine displayed similar ACE2 levels to that of controls, except a decrease in one of the ACE2 fragments. Uniquely, patients treated with azathioprine or with ustekinumab showed partial recovery in the reduction of the TMPRSS2-prodomain fragment characterized in treatment-naïve patients.

Biologics that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are first-line biologics in IBD, used widely for their effectiveness, steroid-sparing quality, and lower cost. While they enable a significant proportion of patients to achieve clinical remission, they carry an increased risk of infection and poor serological responses to vaccination. Conversely, our understanding of adaptive T cell responses in anti-TNF-treated IBD patients remains limited. The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has prompted research that both challenges and refines our view on immunomodulatory therapy and its potential implications for immunity and protection.

Navigating SARS-CoV-2-related immunopathology in Crohn's disease: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutic challenges.,Nov 2024,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only posed major health and economic burdens to international societies but also threatens patients with comorbidities and underlying autoimmune disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) patients. As the vaccinated population is gradually relieved from the stress of the latest omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 due to competent immune responses, the anxiety of CD patients, especially those on immunosuppressive treatment, has not subsided. Whether the use of immunosuppressants for remission of CD outweighs the potential risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has long been discussed. Thus, for the best benefit of CD patients, our primary goal in this study was to navigate the clinical management of CD during the COVID pandemic. Herein, we summarized COVID-19 outcomes of CD patients treated with immunosuppressive agents from multiple cohort studies and also investigated possible mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 impacts the host immunity with special consideration of CD patients. We first looked into the SARS-CoV-2-related immunopathology, including lymphocytopenia, T-cell exhaustion, cytokine storms, and their possible molecular interactions, and then focused on mechanistic actions of gastrointestinal systems, including interruption of tryptophan absorption, development of dysbiosis, and consequent local and systemic inflammation. Given challenges in managing CD, we summarized up-to-date clinical and molecular evidence to help physicians adjust therapeutic strategies to achieve the best clinical outcomes for CD patients.","Chen, Chang-Cyuan; Lin, Yu-An; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Huang, Chun-Yao; Shih, Chun-Ming; Lee, Yuan-Ti; Pan, Jun-Liang; Lee, Ai-Wei",Virology journal,1743-422X,10.1186/s12985-024-02529-1,39538233,"Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Education, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Department of General Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Taipei Heart Institute, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; Taipei Heart Institute, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.; School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City, 40201, Taiwan.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, 40201, Taiwan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan. a23016735@yahoo.com.tw.; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan. ammielee@tmu.edu.tw.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39538233,

Postoperative multiple perforations of the small bowel in a patient with COVID-19 - case report.,2024,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presented quite a diverse symptomatology, in addition to respiratory symptoms, while other clinical signs such as thrombosis, postoperative hemorrhages, acute kidney or liver failure, digestive disorders (vomiting and diarrheal stools) were also reported. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with transverse colon neoplasm and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) of the Emergency County Clinical Hospital, Craiova, Romania, with a clinical picture of low intestinal occlusion. Surgery was decided and a right hemicolectomy extended to the left, with terminal ileostomy performed. The postoperative evolution was favorable, with the resumption of intestinal transit and discharge on the third postoperative day. The patient returned to the ER Department on the fifth day after surgery, with diffuse abdominal pain, absence of intestinal transit and flatulence. Clinical examination of the abdomen revealed the presence of bloating sounds on palpation. Emergency laparotomy was again performed with the suspicion of postoperative occlusion and five perforations were found in the small bowel, associated with fecaloid peritonitis and mechanic-inflammatory occlusion. The perforations were without any obvious lesion substrate, four of them being located on the jejunum and one on the terminal ileum. The histopathological examination revealed hemorrhage and recent transmural thrombosis on the intestinal wall, most likely caused by COVID-19. Without any respiratory symptoms, the COVID-19 infection caused multiple intestinal lesions, leading to peritonitis and septic shock, followed by the patient's death.","Dumitrescu, Theodor Viorel; Meşină, Cristian; Ciorbagiu, Mihai Călin; Lascu, Luana Corina; Honţaru, Sorina Octavia; Ionovici, Nina; Mogoantă, Laurenţiu; Mogoantă, Stelian Ştefăniţă",Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie,2066-8279,10.47162/RJME.65.3.16,39529347,"Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania; laurentiu_mogoanta@yahoo.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39529347,

Gastrointestinal Sequelae of COVID-19: Investigating Post-Infection Complications-A Systematic Review.,Sep 2024,"Gastrointestinal (GI) complications are significant manifestations of COVID-19 and are increasingly being recognized. These complications range from severe acute pancreatitis to colitis, adding complexity to diagnosis and management. A comprehensive database search was conducted using several databases. Our inclusion criteria encompassed studies reporting severe and long-term GI complications of COVID-19. Digestive disorders were categorized into infections, inflammatory conditions, vascular disorders, structural abnormalities, other diagnoses, and undiagnosed conditions. Of the 73 studies that were selected for full-text review, only 24 met our inclusion criteria. The study highlights a broad range of gastrointestinal complications following COVID-19 infection (excluding liver complications, which are examined separately), including inflammatory conditions, such as ulcerative colitis (UC), acute pancreatitis, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Other GI complications were reported such as vascular disorders, including diverse thrombotic events and structural abnormalities, which ranged from bowel perforations to adhesions. Additionally, undiagnosed conditions like nausea and abdominal pain were prevalent across different studies involving 561 patients. The findings emphasize the substantial impact of COVID-19 on the GI tract. Ongoing research and monitoring are crucial to understanding the long-term effects and developing effective management strategies for these complications.","Mohammed, Ibrahim; Podhala, Sudharsan; Zamir, Fariha; Shiyam, Shamha; Salameh, Abdel Rahman; Salahuddin, Zoya; Salameh, Huda; Kim, Chaehyun; Sinan, Zena; Kim, Jeongyeon; Al-Abdulla, Deema; Laws, Sa'ad; Mushannen, Malik; Zakaria, Dalia",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v16101516,39459851,"Department of Medicine, Albany Medical College, New York, NY 12208, USA.; Department of Medical Education, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha P.O.

We administered questionnaires, analyzing SAEs experienced within 31 days following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. About two-thirds (63%) of 1556 participants were female; the mean age was 52.5 years. The BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine was the most common, with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) being second. A total of 49% of participants had IBD, 27.4% had RA, 14.3% had PsA, 5.3% had SpA, and 4% had SLE. Twelve (0.77% of 1556 participants) SAEs leading to an ED visit or hospitalization were self-reported, occurring in 11 participants. SAEs included six (0.39% of 1556 participants) ED visits (including one due to Bell's Palsy 31 days after first vaccination) and six (0.39% of 1556 participants) hospitalizations (including one due to Guillain-Barré syndrome 15 days after the first vaccination). Two SAEs included pericarditis, one involved SLE (considered a serious disease flare), and one involved RA. Thus, in the 31 days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in our IMID sample, very few serious adverse events occurred. As SARS-CoV2 continues to be a common cause of death, our findings may help optimize vaccination acceptance.","Tsyruk, Olga; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Fortin, Paul R; Hitchon, Carol A; Chandran, Vinod; Larché, Maggie J; Avina-Zubieta, Antonio; Boire, Gilles; Colmegna, Ines; Lacaille, Diane; Lalonde, Nadine; Proulx, Laurie; Richards, Dawn P; Boivin, Natalie; DeBow, Christopher; Kovalova-Wood, Lucy; Paleczny, Deborah; Wilhelm, Linda; Lukusa, Luck; Pereira, Daniel; Lee, Jennifer Lf; Bernatsky, Sasha; On Behalf Of The Succeed Investigative Team,",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines12091027,39340057,"Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Departments of Medicine and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.; Centre de Recherche ARThrite-UL, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.; Axe Maladies Infectieuses et Immunitaires, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Québec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3A 1R9, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3H2, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.; Arthritis Research Canada and Division of Rheumatology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Y 3P2, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC J1H 5N4, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Arthritis Research Canada and Division of Rheumatology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Y 3P2, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Toronto, ON L6A 4Z6, Canada.; The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.; The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39340057,

Extracellular Vesicle-Enclosed Oxidative Stress- and Inflammation-Related microRNAs as Potential Biomarkers of Vitamin D Responsivity: A Pilot Study on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients with or without COVID-19.,Aug 2024,"The relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, genomic response to vitamin D (Vit.D), and positivity to SARS-CoV-2 remains understudied. In this pilot study, during the follow-up of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and COVID-19, we investigated this issue by analyzing the molecular contents of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) from six groups of IBD patients (n = 32), classified according to anti-SARS-CoV-2 status, 25(OH)D level, and Vit.D supplementation, by small RNA-seq. This analysis revealed differentially expressed miRNAs, PIWI-RNA, transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNAs, and protein-coding RNAs in the EVs obtained from these cohorts of IBD patients. Experimental validation evidenced a statistically significant increase in miR30d-5p, miR150-5p, Let-7f-5p, and Let-7a-5p in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-positive and low 25(OH)D and Vit.D supplemented groups with respect to the non-Vit.D supplemented group, indicating their responsiveness to Vit.D treatment. Bioinformatics analysis highlighted the regulation of these validated miRNAs by oxidative stress and inflammation, hallmarks of IBD and COVID-19. Our study reports an unprecedented panel of circulating EV-enclosed inflammation- and oxidative stress-related miRNAs, the potentiality of which, as biomarkers for Vit.D responsivity in IBD patients, needs to be explored in future studies on larger cohorts in order to allow clinicians to optimize current treatment strategies upon viral infection.","Ammirata, Giorgia; Arigoni, Maddalena; Licastro, Danilo; Caviglia, Gian Paolo; Disabato, Michela; Zubair, Ghania; Bezzio, Cristina; Saibeni, Simone; De Nicolò, Amedeo; Cusato, Jessica; Palermiti, Alice; Manca, Alessandra; Tolosano, Emanuela; Cozzini, Stefano; Mancini, Marcello; Altruda, Fiorella; D'Avolio, Antonio; Ribaldone, Davide Giuseppe; Ala, Ugo; Fagoonee, Sharmila","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2076-3921,10.3390/antiox13091047,39334706,"Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Centre ""Guido Tarone"", University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Centre ""Guido Tarone"", University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; AREA Science Park, Padriciano, 34149 Trieste, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; Department of Mathematics ""Giuseppe Peano"", University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; IBD Centre, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, 20089 Rozzano, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, 20072 Pieve Emanuele, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Rho Hospital, ASST Rhodense, 20017 Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10149 Turin, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10149 Turin, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10149 Turin, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10149 Turin, Italy.; Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Centre ""Guido Tarone"", University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.; AREA Science Park, Padriciano, 34149 Trieste, Italy.; Institute for Biostructure and Bioimaging, CNR, Via T.

DPP-IV as a potential candidate in anti-obesity and obesity-related diseases treatment.,Nov 2024,"Along with social development and lifestyle changes, the number of overweight and obese patients worldwide is rising annually. Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease with complex etiology. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a novel adipokine with significantly elevated expression in the visceral fat of obese patients. DPP-IV is a molecule that regulates metabolic homeostasis and inflammatory processes. Through its enzymatic activity, it plays a significant part in achieving hypoglycemic and weight loss effects through various pathways. DPP-IV and DPP-IV inhibitors also have pleiotropic effects in modulating obesity-related diseases by reducing obesity-related inflammation, ameliorating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), improving hepatic steatosis and lowering cardiovascular risk, and even decreasing the risk of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). This paper reviews the mechanisms of action based on DPP-IV targets in obesity and metabolic homeostasis, as well as their active role in the treatment of chronic diseases associated with obesity.","Guo, Xin; Feng, Huolun; Cai, Liyang; Zheng, Jiabin; Li, Yong",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,1950-6007,10.1016/j.biopha.2024.117464,39326107,"Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.

In this study, we examined how people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) managed their autoimmune disease, considering their increased susceptibility to contracting COVID-19. Specifically, we analyzed how people with IBD made sense of their precarious position through the writing of publicly accessible blogs. We found that for IBD patients, navigating healthcare needs in the context of pandemic-related concerns and restrictions meant grappling with several salient, but conflicting tensions: separation vs. connection, safety vs. exposure, uncertainty vs. control, and resilience vs. vulnerability. People with IBD struggled to find a balance between living with IBD while keeping themselves and their loved ones safe from the virus. While the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic may be over, the underlying disease, and the tensions the disease causes, is still present for people with IBD.","Frohlich, Dennis Owen; Abdul Wahab, Sally",Health communication,1532-7027,10.1080/10410236.2024.2394717,39212234,"Department of Media and Journalism, Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania.; Department of Communication, Media and Journalism, Kean University.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39212234,

Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Crohn's Patients on Adalimumab Who Received COVID-19 Vaccination.,Aug 2024,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the gastrointestinal tract that can also cause extra-intestinal complications. Following exposure to the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, some patients experienced a lack of response to the biological drug Adalimumab and a recrudescence of the disease. In CD patients in progression, resistant to considered biological therapy, an abnormal increase in intestinal permeability was observed, more often with a modulated expression of different proteins such as Aquaporin 8 (AQP8) and in tight junctions (e.g., ZO-1, Claudin1, Claudin2, Occludin), especially during disease flares. The aim of this study is to investigate how the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could interfere with IBD therapy and contribute to disease exacerbation. We investigated the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), and the impact of various EVs components, namely, exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs), in modulating the expression of molecules involved in the exacerbation of CD, which remains unknown.","De Luca, Maria;

Systemic and Mucosal Immunogenicity of Monovalent XBB.1.5-Adapted COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Jul 2024,"Recently updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccines encode the spike protein of the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 and are recommended for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunosuppressive treatment. Nonetheless, their immunogenicity in patients with IBD against rapidly expanding virus variants remains unknown. This prospective multicenter cohort study is the first study to investigate the immunogenicity of XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines in patients with IBD. Systemic and mucosal antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, and BA.2.86, as well as their neutralization were quantified before and two to four weeks after vaccination with monovalent XBB.1.5-adapted mRNA vaccines. Vaccination increased levels of serum anti-RBD IgG targeting XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, and BA.2.86 (1.9-fold, 1.8-fold, and 2.6-fold, respectively) and enhanced corresponding neutralization responses (2.3-fold, 3.1-fold, and 3.5-fold, respectively). Following vaccination, anti-TNF-treated patients had reduced virus neutralization compared to patients on treatments with other cellular targets. 11.1% and 16.7% of patients lacked EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 neutralization, respectively; all these patients received anti-TNF treatment. At mucosal sites, vaccination induced variant-specific anti-RBD IgG but failed to induce RBD-targeting IgA. Our findings provide a basis for future vaccine recommendations while highlighting the importance of frequent booster vaccine adaptation and the need for mucosal vaccination strategies in patients with IBD.","Woelfel, Simon; Dütschler, Joel; Junker, Daniel; König, Marius; Leinenkugel, Georg; Graf, Nicole; Krieger, Claudia; Truniger, Samuel; Franke, Annett; Koller, Seraina; Metzger-Peter, Katline; Oberholzer, Melanie; Frei, Nicola; Geissler, Nora; Schaub, Peter; Star Sign Investigators,; Albrich, Werner C; Friedrich, Matthias; Niess, Jan Hendrik; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Dulovic, Alex; Korte, Wolfgang; Bürgi, Justus J; Brand, Stephan",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines12070774,39066413,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Max von Pettenkofer Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU), 80333 Munich, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Outpatient Clinic, Ambulatory Services Rorschach, 9400 Rorschach, Switzerland.; NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tübingen, 72770 Reutlingen, Germany.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Digestive Healthcare Center, Clarunis, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.; Clinical Trials Unit, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Outpatient Clinic, Ambulatory Services Rorschach, 9400 Rorschach, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Outpatient Clinic, Ambulatory Services Rorschach, 9400 Rorschach, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Digestive Healthcare Center, Clarunis, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.; Center for Laboratory Medicine, 9001 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Infection Prevention, & Travel Medicine, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Digestive Healthcare Center, Clarunis, 4002 Basel, Switzerland.; Gastroenterology Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.; NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tübingen, 72770 Reutlingen, Germany.; NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tübingen, 72770 Reutlingen, Germany.; Center for Laboratory Medicine, 9001 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Center for Laboratory Medicine, 9001 St. Gallen, Switzerland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, 9007 St. Gallen, Switzerland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39066413,
"The interplay between cytokines, inflammation, and antioxidants: mechanistic insights and therapeutic potentials of various antioxidants and anti-cytokine compounds.",Sep 2024,"Cytokines regulate immune responses essential for maintaining immune homeostasis, as deregulated cytokine signaling can lead to detrimental outcomes, including inflammatory disorders. The antioxidants emerge as promising therapeutic agents because they mitigate oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory pathways. Antioxidants can potentially ameliorate inflammation-related disorders by counteracting excessive cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses. A comprehensive understanding of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways and the interplay with antioxidants is paramount for developing natural therapeutic agents targeting inflammation-related disorders and helping to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for patients. Among these antioxidants, curcumin, vitamin C, vitamin D, propolis, allicin, and cinnamaldehyde have garnered attention for their anti-inflammatory properties and potential therapeutic benefits. This review highlights the interrelationship between cytokines-mediated disorders in various diseases and therapeutic approaches involving antioxidants.","Bhol, Nitish Kumar; Bhanjadeo, Madhabi Madhusmita; Singh, Anup Kumar; Dash, Umesh Chandra; Ojha, Rakesh Ranjan; Majhi, Sanatan; Duttaroy, Asim K; Jena, Atala Bihari",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,1950-6007,10.1016/j.biopha.2024.117177,39053423,"Post Graduate Department of Biotechnology, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 751004, India.; KIIT school of Biotechnology, KIIT University, Patia, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 751024, India.; National Centre for Cell Science, Savitribai Phule Pune University Campus, Ganeshkhind, Pune, India.; Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, KIIT School of Biotechnology, KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.; Department of Bioinformatics, BJB (A) College, Bhubaneswar, Odisha-751014, India.; Post Graduate Department of Biotechnology, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 751004, India.; Department of Nutrition, Institute of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.

Ileocecal Intussusception in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C): A Case Report and Literature Review.,Jun 2024,"Ileocecal intussusception (ICI) is the most common abdominal emergency and cause of intestinal obstruction in young children, carrying a high risk of mortality and morbidity. Enteric viral infectious and inflammatory syndromes are known triggers for intussusception (ileoileal and ileocolic) by causing mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia that may act as a leading point allowing the bowel to invaginate into itself. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, with a subset of patients solely having GI complaints at the time of presentation.  COVID-19 as a trigger for intussusception in children has been hypothesized and suggested in multiple cases reported to date, both during the acute phase of illness and as a part of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We present a seven-month-old male who developed ICI and became a diagnostic dilemma due to viral co-infections and the gradual emergence of MIS-C during the hospital stay. We are describing this presentation in an attempt to expand the understanding of the implications of COVID-19 and MIS-C in this young and unique age group.","Alla, Niharika; Abdul-Hadi, Thaer; Litra, Florentina",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.62731,39036184,"Pediatrics, University of Florida, Pensacola, USA.; Pediatrics, Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, Pensacola, USA.; Pediatrics, University of Florida, Pensacola, USA.; Pediatrics, University of Florida, Pensacola, USA.; Pediatrics, Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, Pensacola, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036184,

Acute and Long COVID Intestinal Changes in an Experimental Model of Coronavirus in Mice.,May 2024,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in early 2020, has had a profound and lasting impact on global health, resulting in over 7.0 million deaths and persistent challenges. In addition to acute concerns, there is growing attention being given to the long COVID health consequences for survivors of COVID-19 with documented cases of cardiovascular abnormalities, liver disturbances, lung complications, kidney issues, and noticeable cognitive deficits. Recent studies have investigated the physiological changes in various organs following prolonged exposure to murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1), a coronavirus, in mouse models. One significant finding relates to the effects on the gastrointestinal tract, an area previously understudied regarding the long-lasting effects of COVID-19. This research sheds light on important observations in the intestines during both the acute and the prolonged phases following MHV-1 infection, which parallel specific changes seen in humans after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Our study investigates the histopathological alterations in the small intestine following MHV-1 infection in murine models, revealing significant changes reminiscent of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease. Notable findings include mucosal inflammation, lymphoid hyperplasia, goblet cell hyperplasia, and immune cell infiltration, mirroring pathological features observed in IBD. Additionally, MHV-1 infection induces villous atrophy, altered epithelial integrity, and inflammatory responses akin to celiac disease and IBD. SPIKENET (SPK) treatment effectively mitigates intestinal damage caused by MHV-1 infection, restoring tissue architecture and ameliorating inflammatory responses. Furthermore, investigation into long COVID reveals intricate inflammatory profiles, highlighting the potential of SPK to modulate intestinal responses and restore tissue homeostasis. Understanding these histopathological alterations provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-induced gastrointestinal complications and informs the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","Hussain, Hussain; Elumalai, Nila; Sampath, Natarajan; Shamaladevi, Nagarajarao; Hajjar, Rima; Druyan, Brian Zachary; Rashed, Amirah B; Ramamoorthy, Rajalakshmi; Kenyon, Norma S; Jayakumar, Arumugam R; Paidas, Michael J",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v16060832,38932125,"Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, HCA Florida Kendall Hospital, Miami, FL 33175, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur 613401, India.; Molecular Analytics, Miami, FL 33187, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Microbiology & Immunology and Biomedical Engineering, Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38932125,
Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) in Inflammation and Disease: A Unique Inflammatory Pathway Activator.,May 2024,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a unique protease binding receptor, now recognized as a key regulator of inflammation. Initially, uPA/uPAR was considered thrombolytic (clot-dissolving); however, recent studies have demonstrated its predominant immunomodulatory functions in inflammation and cancer. The uPA/uPAR complex has a multifaceted central role in both normal physiological and also pathological responses. uPAR is expressed as a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor interacting with vitronectin, integrins, G protein-coupled receptors, and growth factor receptors within a large lipid raft. Through protein-to-protein interactions, cell surface uPAR modulates intracellular signaling, altering cellular adhesion and migration. The uPA/uPAR also modifies extracellular activity, activating plasminogen to form plasmin, which breaks down fibrin, dissolving clots and activating matrix metalloproteinases that lyse connective tissue, allowing immune and cancer cell invasion and releasing growth factors. uPAR is now recognized as a biomarker for inflammatory diseases and cancer; uPAR and soluble uPAR fragments (suPAR) are increased in viral sepsis (COVID-19), inflammatory bowel disease, and metastasis. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, function, and current studies examining uPAR and suPAR as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Understanding uPAR is central to developing diagnostic markers and the ongoing development of antibody, small-molecule, nanogel, and virus-derived immune-modulating treatments that target uPAR.","Hamada, Mostafa; Varkoly, Kyle Steven; Riyadh, Omer; Beladi, Roxana; Munuswamy-Ramanujam, Ganesh; Rawls, Alan; Wilson-Rawls, Jeanne; Chen, Hao; McFadden, Grant; Lucas, Alexandra R",Biomedicines,2227-9059,10.3390/biomedicines12061167,38927374,"College of Medicine, Kansas City University, 1750 Independence Ave, Kansas City, MO 64106, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, McLaren Macomb Hospital, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, 1000 Harrington St., Mt Clemens, MI 48043, USA.; College of Medicine, Kansas City University, 1750 Independence Ave, Kansas City, MO 64106, USA.; Department of Neurosurgery, Ascension Providence Hospital, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, 16001 W Nine Mile Rd, Southfield, MI 48075, USA.; Molecular Biology and Immunobiology Division, Interdisciplinary Institute of Indian System of Medicine, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur 603203, India.; School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, 427 E Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA.; School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, 427 E Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA.; Department of Tumor Center, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou 730030, China.; Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, 727 E Tyler St., Tempe, AZ 85287, USA.; Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, 727 E Tyler St., Tempe, AZ 85287, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38927374,

Potential protective factors include tobacco abuse, physical activity, urate levels, NSAID use, calcium channel blocker use, statin use, and use of some α1-adrenergic antagonists. Some potential protective factors could be products of reverse causation, including increased serum urate, tobacco abuse, and coffee-tea-caffeine consumption. Potential risk factors include traumatic brain injury, pesticide exposure, organic solvent exposure, lead exposure, air pollution, Type 2 Diabetes, some dairy products, cardiovascular disease, and some infections including Hepatitis C, H. pylori, and COVID-19. Potential non-environmental risk factors include bipolar disorder, essential tremor, bullous pemphigoid, and inflammatory bowel disease. There is an inverse relationship with PD and risk of most cancers. Though many potential protective and risk factors for PD were identified, research has not yet led to unique, rigorous prevention trials or successful disease-modifying interventions. While efforts to reduce exposure to some industrial toxicants are well justified, PD incidence might be most effectively reduced by mitigation of risks, such as Type 2 Diabetes, air pollution, traumatic brain injury, or physical inactivity, that are general public health intervention targets.","Grotewold, Nikolas; Albin, Roger L",Parkinsonism & related disorders,1873-5126,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2024.107026,38879999,"Dept. of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.; Dept. of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA; GRECC & Neurology Service, VAAAHS, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA; University of Michigan Morris K.

Postoperative outcomes of surgical delay in inflammatory bowel disease patients: a multicenter cohort study.,Aug 2024,"Postponement of surgical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care may lead to disease progression. This study aims to determine the influence of delayed surgical IBD procedures on clinical outcomes. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included IBD patients who underwent a surgical procedure during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from March 16, 2020, to December 31, 2020, and were compared to a pre-COVID-19 cohort. The primary endpoint was determining the number of (major) postoperative complications. Secondary endpoints were the time interval between surgical indication and performance of the surgical procedure and the risk factors of postoperative complications using multivariate analysis. Eighty-one IBD patients who underwent a surgical procedure were included. The median time interval between surgical indication and performance of the surgical procedure did not differ between the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 cohorts (34 vs. 33.5 days, p = 0.867). Multivariate analysis revealed a longer time interval between surgical indication and surgical procedure significantly correlated with the risk of developing postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, p = 0.034]. Moreover, previous surgery was identified as an independent predictor (OR 4.25, p = 0.018) for an increased risk of developing major postoperative complications. There was no significant surgical delay for patients with IBD in the COVID-19 pandemic cohort compared to the pre-pandemic cohort. However, a longer time interval between surgical indication and surgical procedure significantly correlated with the risk of developing postoperative complications.

Recent advances in the therapeutic applications of selenium nanoparticles.,May 2024,"Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are an appealing carrier for the targeted delivery. The selenium nanoparticles are gaining global attention because of the potential therapeutic applications in several diseases e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, liver, and various autoimmune disorders like psoriasis, cancer, diabetes, and a variety of infectious diseases. Despite the fact still there is no recent literature that summarises the therapeutic applications of SeNPs. There are some challenges that need to be addressed like finding targets for SeNPs in various diseases, and the various functionalization techniques utilized to increase SeNP's stability while facilitating wide drug-loaded SeNP distribution to tumor areas and preventing off-target impacts need to focus on understanding more about the therapeutic aspects for better understanding the science behind it. Keeping that in mind we have focused on this gap and try to summarize all recent key targeted therapies for SeNPs in cancer treatment and the numerous functionalization strategies. We have also focused on recent advancements in SeNP functionalization methodologies and mechanisms for biomedical applications, particularly in anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infection therapeutics.

The role of interleukin-36 in health and disease states.,Oct 2024,"The interleukin (IL)-1 superfamily upregulates immune responses and maintains homeostasis between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Within the IL-1 superfamily, IL-36 plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Of the four IL-36 isoforms, three have agonist activity (IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ) and the fourth has antagonist activity (IL-36 receptor antagonist [IL-36Ra]). All IL-36 isoforms bind to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R). Binding of IL-36α/β/γ to the IL-36R recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates downstream signalling pathways mediated by nuclear transcription factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways. Antagonist binding of IL-36Ra to IL-36R inhibits recruitment of IL-1RAcP, blocking downstream signalling pathways. Changes in the balance within the IL-36 cytokine family can lead to uncontrolled inflammatory responses throughout the body. As such, IL-36 has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, notably a type of pustular psoriasis called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a chronic, rare, potentially life-threatening, multisystemic skin disease characterised by recurrent fever and extensive sterile pustules. In GPP, IL-36 is central to disease pathogenesis, and the prevention of IL-36-mediated signalling can improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the literature describing the biological functions of the IL-36 pathway. We also consider the evidence for uncontrolled activation of the IL-36 pathway in a wide range of skin (e.g., plaque psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, Netherton syndrome, atopic dermatitis and pyoderma gangrenosum), lung (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), gut (e.g., intestinal fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Hirschsprung's disease), kidney (e.g., renal tubulointerstitial lesions) and infectious diseases caused by a variety of pathogens (e.g., COVID-19; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae infections), as well as in cancer. We also consider how targeting the IL-36 signalling pathway could be used in treating inflammatory disease states.","Sugiura, Kazumitsu; Fujita, Hideki; Komine, Mayumi; Yamanaka, Keiichi; Akiyama, Masashi",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,1468-3083,10.1111/jdv.19935,38779986,"Department of Dermatology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38779986,
IFIH1 loss of function predisposes to inflammatory and SARS-CoV-2-related infectious diseases.,Aug 2024,"The IFIH1 gene, encoding melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), is an indispensable innate immune regulator involved in the early detection of viral infections. Previous studies described MDA5 dysregulation in weakened immunological responses, and increased susceptibility to microbial infections and autoimmune disorders. Monoallelic gain-of-function of the IFIH1 gene has been associated with multisystem disorders, namely Aicardi-Goutieres and Singleton-Merten syndromes, while biallelic loss causes immunodeficiency. In this study, nine patients suffering from recurrent infections, inflammatory diseases, severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) were identified with putative loss-of-function IFIH1 variants by whole-exome sequencing. All patients revealed signs of lymphopaenia and an increase in inflammatory markers, including CRP, amyloid A, ferritin and IL-6. One patient with a pathogenic homozygous variant c.2807+1G>A was the most severe case showing immunodeficiency and glomerulonephritis. The c.1641+1G>C variant was identified in the heterozygous state in patients suffering from periodic fever, COVID-19 or MIS-C, while the c.2016delA variant was identified in two patients with inflammatory bowel disease or MIS-C. There was a significant association between IFIH1 monoallelic loss of function and susceptibility to infections in males. Expression analysis showed that PBMCs of one patient with a c.2016delA variant had a significant decrease in ISG15, IFNA and IFNG transcript levels, compared to normal PBMCs, upon stimulation with Poly(I:C), suggesting that MDA5 receptor truncation disrupts the immune response. Our findings accentuate the implication of rare monogenic IFIH1 loss-of-function variants in altering the immune response, and severely predisposing patients to inflammatory and infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2-related disorders.","Najm, Rania; Yavuz, Lemis; Jain, Ruchi; El Naofal, Maha; Ramaswamy, Sathishkumar; Abuhammour, Walid; Loney, Tom; Nowotny, Norbert; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Abou Tayoun, Ahmad; Kandasamy, Richard K",Scandinavian journal of immunology,1365-3083,10.1111/sji.13373,38757311,"College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Children's Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Genomics Center of Excellence, Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Genomics Center of Excellence, Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Genomics Center of Excellence, Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Children's Hospital, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Al Jalila Genomics Center of Excellence, Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, Dubai Health, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.; Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal, India.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38757311,

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 Variant Infection of Human Colon Epithelial Cells.,Apr 2024,"The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by multiple subvariants including BA.1, XBB.1.5, EG.5, and JN.1, became the predominant strain in early 2022. Studies indicate that Omicron replicates less efficiently in lung tissue compared to the ancestral strain. However, the infectivity of Omicron in the gastrointestinal tract is not fully defined, despite the fact that 70% of COVID-19 patients experience digestive disease symptoms. Here, using primary human colonoids, we found that, regardless of individual variability, Omicron infects colon cells similarly or less effectively than the ancestral strain or the Delta variant. The variant induced limited type III interferon expression and showed no significant impact on epithelial integrity. Further experiments revealed inefficient cell-to-cell spread and spike protein cleavage in the Omicron spike protein, possibly contributing to its lower infectious particle levels. The findings highlight the variant-specific replication differences in human colonoids, providing insights into the enteric tropism of Omicron and its relevance to long COVID symptoms.","Antia, Avan; Alvarado, David M; Zeng, Qiru; Casorla-Perez, Luis A; Davis, Deanna L; Sonnek, Naomi M; Ciorba, Matthew A; Ding, Siyuan",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v16040634,38675974,"Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38675974,
Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Diseases-From Expectations to Reality.,Apr 2024,"Viral infections have always been considered a threat to global health, with numerous outbreaks across time. Despite the relative recent experience with coronavirus-associated diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome-2's (SARS-CoV-2) continuous evolution displays a different behavior. With a tropism for both respiratory and digestive mucosa, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seem to share a particular common background. Current literature offers evidence that viral alteration of the immune system, inflammatory intestinal tissue damage, increased intestinal permeability, incomplete viral clearance with viral antigen persistence, and intestinal dysbiosis, might explain SARS-CoV-2-IBD relationship in terms of etiopathogenesis and evolution. The hyperinflammatory state that both entities have in common explains the lack of success of current IBD therapy, raising the need for new personalized therapeutic options, with better outcomes for IBD and COVID-19 as well. This review aims to summarize the current available data on pediatric IBD evolution, management, and outcomes in the post-COVID period, with an emphasis on the particular aspects of the SARS-CoV-2-IBD relationship in children.","Trandafir, Laura Mihaela; Spoiala, Elena Lia; Ghiga, Gabriela; Gimiga, Nicoleta; Budescu, Paula-Diana; Lupu, Vasile Valeriu; Butnariu, Lacramioara; Cojocaru, Elena; Paduraru, Gabriela",Journal of personalized medicine,2075-4426,10.3390/jpm14040399,38673026,"Faculty of Medicine, ""Grigore T.

The most common complaints are fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, taste and smell disorders, as well as problems with memory and concentration. Pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 syndrome is complicated and not fully understood, but it is likely related to an overactive immune system, disturbances in the intestinal microbiome, and cell and tissue damage caused by the virus.

The gastrointestinal microbiota in the development of ME/CFS: a critical view and potential perspectives.,2024,"Like other infections, a SARS-CoV-2 infection can also trigger Post-Acute Infection Syndromes (PAIS), which often progress into myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS, characterized by post-exercise malaise (PEM), is a severe multisystemic disease for which specific diagnostic markers or therapeutic concepts have not been established. Despite numerous indications of post-infectious neurological, immunological, endocrinal, and metabolic deviations, the exact causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. To date, there is a paucity of data, that changes in the composition and function of the gastrointestinal microbiota have emerged as a potential influencing variable associated with immunological and inflammatory pathways, shifts in ME/CFS. It is postulated that this dysbiosis may lead to intestinal barrier dysfunction, translocation of microbial components with increased oxidative stress, and the development or progression of ME/CFS. In this review, we detailed discuss the findings regarding alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and its microbial mediators in ME/CFS. When viewed critically, there is currently no evidence indicating causality between changes in the microbiota and the development of ME/CFS. Most studies describe associations within poorly defined patient populations, often combining various clinical presentations, such as irritable bowel syndrome and fatigue associated with ME/CFS. Nevertheless, drawing on analogies with other gastrointestinal diseases, there is potential to develop strategies aimed at modulating the gut microbiota and/or its metabolites as potential treatments for ME/CFS and other PAIS.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases.,Dec 2023,"Understanding the profound impact of a viral pandemic on the mental health of patients with autoimmune diseases undergoing biological treatment is crucial for future insights. This cross-sectional case-control study aimed to assess the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Romania, spanning from November 2022 to March 2023. A specialized self-report questionnaire in the Romanian language was developed to measure the multifaceted effects of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of these patients. The findings revealed a significant decline in the mental health of patients with IBD during the pandemic compared to the control group. Patients with IBD exhibited elevated levels of anxiety and concern regarding the virus. Intriguingly, despite the challenges, the vaccination rate was notably higher among patients with IBD, indicating a proactive approach to safeguarding their health. The study also shed light on various coping mechanisms employed by patients with IBD to navigate the pandemic-related restrictions. Engaging in activities such as social media and computer games emerged as effective strategies for managing heightened stress and limitations. In conclusion, the emergence of a novel viral pathogen represents a significant distress factor for patients with autoimmune diseases. Recognizing and comprehending these consequences enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay between physical and mental health and equips authorities with valuable insights to better manage future epidemics or viral outbreaks.

Using clinical cases to guide healthcare.,Mar 2024,"Evidence-based practice (EBP) has been the gold standard in healthcare for nearly three centuries and aims to assist physicians in providing the safest and most effective healthcare for their patients. The well-established hierarchy of evidence lists systematic reviews and meta-analyses at the top however these methodologies are not always appropriate or possible and in these instances case-control studies, case series and case reports are utilised to support EBP. Case-control studies allow simultaneous study of multiple risk factors and can be performed rapidly and relatively cheaply. A recent example was during the Coronavirus pandemic where case-control studies were used to assess the efficacy of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. Case series and case reports also play a role in EBP and are particularly useful to study rare diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease in transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. They are also vital in generating and disseminating early signals and encouraging further research. Whilst these methodologies have weaknesses, particularly with regards to bias and loss of patient confidentiality for rare pathologies, they have an important part to play in EBP and when appropriately utilised can significantly impact upon clinical practice.","Colwill, Michael; Baillie, Samantha; Pollok, Richard; Poullis, Andrew",World journal of clinical cases,2307-8960,10.12998/wjcc.v12.i9.1555,38576735,"Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, United Kingdom. michael.colwill@nhs.net.; Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, United Kingdom.; Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, United Kingdom.; Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London SW17 0QT, United Kingdom.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38576735,

The Role of Myeloid Cells in Thromboinflammatory Disease.,Oct 2024,"Inflammation contributes to the development of thrombosis, but the mechanistic basis for this association remains poorly understood. Innate immune responses and coagulation pathways are activated in parallel following infection or injury, and represent an important host defense mechanism to limit pathogen spread in the bloodstream. However, dysregulated proinflammatory activity is implicated in the progression of venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis. In this review, we focus on the role of myeloid cells in propagating thromboinflammation in acute inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Myeloid cells are considered key drivers of thromboinflammation via upregulated tissue factor activity, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), contact pathway activation, and aberrant coagulation factor-mediated protease-activated receptor (PAR) signaling. We discuss how strategies to target the intersection between myeloid cell-mediated inflammation and activation of blood coagulation represent an exciting new approach to combat immunothrombosis. Specifically, repurposed anti-inflammatory drugs, immunometabolic regulators, and NETosis inhibitors present opportunities that have the potential to dampen immunothrombotic activity without interfering with hemostasis. Such therapies could have far-reaching benefits for patient care across many thromboinflammatory conditions.","Noone, David; Preston, Roger J S; Rehill, Aisling M",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,1098-9064,10.1055/s-0044-1782660,38547918,"Irish Centre for Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.; National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.; Irish Centre for Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.; National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.; Irish Centre for Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.; National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38547918,
Revolutionizing Treatment Strategies for Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disorders: The Impact of Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 Inhibitors.,2024,"DPP4 (Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4) a versatile protease, emerges as a prominent player in soluble and membrane-bound forms. Its heightened expression has been intimately linked to the initiation and severity of diverse autoimmune diseases, spanning rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis (SSc), inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diabetes, and even SARS-CoV-2 infection. Operating as a co-stimulator of T cell activity, DPP4 propels T cell proliferation by binding adenosine deaminase (ADA), thereby augmenting the breakdown of adenosine-an influential inhibitor of T cell proliferation. However, the discovery of a wide range of DPP4 inhibitors has shown promise in alleviating these diseases' signs, symptoms, and severity. The available DPP4 inhibitors have demonstrated significant effectiveness in blocking DPP4 activity. Based on the characterization of their binding mechanisms, three distinct groups of DPP4 inhibitors have been identified: saxagliptin, alogliptin, and sitagliptin, each representing a different class. Elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression are associated with producing various coronavirus peptidases.

Functional Recovery and Regenerative Effects of Direct Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in Treatment of Post-COVID-19 Guillain-Barré and Acute Transverse Myelitis Overlap Syndrome: A Clinical Case.,Feb 2024,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has proven effective in treating pain in many experimental and clinical studies. In addition to the analgesic effect, direct TENS of peripheral nerves had anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects in the treatment of distal polyneuropathy and spinal cord injury. This work demonstrates the experience of using direct TENS in the treatment of a 52-year-old patient with post-COVID-19 Guillain-Barré (GBS) and acute transverse myelitis (ATM) overlap syndrome. Direct TENS of peripheral nerves showed high efficiency in enhancing the therapeutic effect of combined plasma exchange and pharmacotherapy by 89.5% with a significant reduction in neuropathic pain, motor and sensory deficits, bladder and bowel disorders and regression of neurophysiological changes. We suggest that direct TENS of peripheral nerves can be a promising option for combined therapy of GBS and ATM overlap syndrome and other diseases with the simultaneous development of distal polyneuropathy and spinal cord injury. Further trial studies are required.","Al-Zamil, Mustafa; Kulikova, Natalia G; Minenko, Inessa A; Mansur, Numman; Zalozhnev, Denis M; Uzdenov, Marat B; Dzhanibekova, Alina A; Gochiyayev, Alikhan A; Shnayder, Natalia A",Journal of functional morphology and kinesiology,2411-5142,10.3390/jfmk9010040,38535420,"Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Continuing Medical Education, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, 117198 Moscow, Russia.; Department of Restorative Medicine and Neurorehabilitation, Medical Dental Institute, 127253 Moscow, Russia.; Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Continuing Medical Education, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, 117198 Moscow, Russia.; Department of Sports Medicine and Medical Rehabilitation, I.M.

We report about a 26-year-old female patient with longstanding Crohn's disease, who was admitted to our hospital with suspicion of an acute attack with suggestive symptoms and increased significantly inflammatory parameters. Shortly before, symptomatic COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2 variant omicron) had been made. Comprehensive endoscopic and imaging diagnostics ruled out active Crohn's disease. However, inflammatory thickening of the aortic arch was seen, and a diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis (type II b) was made. Steroid therapy resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement of clinical symptoms. The occurrence of Takayasu arteritis is extremely rare outside Japan. An coincidence has been described in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and is discussed as a possible extraintestinal manifestation. The occurrence of immune-mediated disease after COVID-19 disease has been described and may be triggered by the infection. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease may represent a special risk population.","Kollecker, Tristan; Nistal, Markus; Waltz, Volker; Ehard, Florian; Moellers, Mark; Gundling, Felix",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,1439-7803,10.1055/a-2187-9295,38417807,"Med.

"Vitamin K: Infection, Inflammation, and Auto-Immunity.",2024,"Vitamin K (VK) comprises a group of substances with chlorophyll quinone bioactivity and exists in nature in the form of VK1 and VK2. As its initial recognition originated from the ability to promote blood coagulation, it is known as the coagulation vitamin. However, based on extensive research, VK has shown potential for the prevention and treatment of various diseases. Studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of VK on immunity, antioxidant capacity, intestinal microbiota regulation, epithelial development, and bone protection have drawn growing interest in recent years. This review article focuses on the mechanism of action of VK and its potential preventive and therapeutic effects on infections (eg, asthma, COVID-19), inflammation (eg, in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer, aging, atherosclerosis) and autoimmune disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis). In addition, VK-dependent proteins (VKDPs) are another crucial mechanism by which VK exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. This review explores the potential role of VK in preventing aging, combating neurological abnormalities, and treating diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Although current research appoints VK as a therapeutic tool for practical clinical applications in infections, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases, future research is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of action in more detail and overcome current limitations.","Xie, Yuanyuan; Li, Shifang; Wu, Dinan; Wang, Yining; Chen, Jiepeng; Duan, Lili; Li, Shuzhuang; Li, Yuyuan",Journal of inflammation research,1178-7031,10.2147/JIR.S445806,38406326,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.; The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.; Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.; Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.; Sungen Bioscience Co., Ltd, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.; Sungen Bioscience Co., Ltd, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.; College of Basic Medical Science, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.; Advanced Institute for Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, People's Republic of China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38406326,

Humoral immune response and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease.,Apr 2024,"Children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) may respond differently to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunization compared to healthy children or other patients with IBD. We recruited children with VEO-IBD <6 years of age and younger following receipt of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Demographics, IBD characteristics, medication use, adverse events (AEs) and IBD exacerbations were collected. Blood draws (optional) were obtained for measurement of antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies following vaccination. Of 41 participants, none required emergency department visit or hospitalization due to AE, and only one experienced IBD exacerbation. Detectable antibody was present in 19/19 participants who provided blood sample; 6/7 participants (86%) had durable humoral response 12 months postvaccination. Children with VEO-IBD experience robust humoral immune response to COVID-19 immunization. Severe AEs were rare.

How Did COVID-19 Affect Mental Health and Access to Care in Persons With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Feb 2024,"The coronavirus disease pandemic globally affected public health and the world economy, leading to an increase in mental health symptoms, thought to be due in part to periods of quarantining, restrictions, and other interventions used to curb ongoing transmission of the virus. It is well established that persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety than the general population and that mental health symptoms can exacerbate disease severity. For persons with IBD, psychological distress was correlated with challenges in accessing medical care. In the early stages of the pandemic, endoscopy suites were closed, leading to fewer colonoscopies, although this rebounded the following year. This likely led to fewer diagnoses of IBD initially as people avoided the health care system, and also a reduction in IBD-related dysplasia being detected during colonoscopy. Many hospitals and health care clinics adjusted by delivering telemedicine for ambulatory care. Persons with IBD had increased stress about accessing both their health care provider and gastroenterologist during the pandemic, although many had increased satisfaction with the level of care they received virtually. Telemedicine is now being used in most clinics in conjunction with in-person care, to help deliver care, and can be cost-effective. Additional research is needed to assess whether heightened levels of mental health symptoms have led to worsening disease activity, and further, if a delay in health care access including colonoscopies and surgeries, or the perceived decreased access to health care professionals for some will have detrimentally affected the disease course for persons with IBD.","Shaffer, Seth R",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwad033,38314179,"Section of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38314179,

However, cases of AGU associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare, and this disease significantly impairs human quality of life. In this case, we report a 37-year-old woman who presented with a five-day history of a painful genital ulcer and fever. A month earlier, she had experienced a COVID-19 infection that resolved without medical therapy. Physical examination revealed that multiple asymmetric ulcers presented on labia minora covered with whitish exudates. The patient, without any high-risk sexual behavior, or a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders or inflammatory bowel disease, was diagnosed with COVID-19-related AGU after ruling out other infectious and immune diseases. Following a two-week treatment of oral prednisone, her vulvar edema, ulcers, and fever improved significantly.

Cytokine signature in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving vedolizumab.,Jan 2024,"While differential antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving infliximab and vedolizumab are well-characterized, the immune pathways underlying these differences remain unknown. Prior to COVID-19 vaccine development, we screened 235 patients with IBD receiving biological therapy for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and measured serum cytokines. In seropositive patients, we prospectively collected clinical data. We found a cytokine signature in patients receiving vedolizumab who are seropositive compared with seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may be linked to repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, there were no differences between seropositive and seronegative patients receiving infliximab. In this single-center cohort of patients with IBD with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore without influence of vaccination, there is a cytokine signature in patients receiving vedolizumab but not infliximab. These findings lay the groundwork for further studies on immune consequences of viral infection in patients with IBD, which is postulated to evolve from aberrant host-microbe responses.","Dallari, Simone; Martinez Pazos, Vicky; Munoz Eusse, Juan; Wellens, Judith; Thompson, Craig; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Satsangi, Jack; Cadwell, Ken; Wong, Serre-Yu; ,",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-023-50035-1,38168138,"Department of Microbiology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, USA.; The Henry D.

Unravelling the cellular response to the SARS-COV-2 vaccine in inflammatory bowel disease patients on biologic drugs.,Dec 2023,"Suboptimal vaccine response is a significant concern in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) receiving biologic drugs. This single-center observational study involved 754 patients with IBD. In Phase I (October 2020-April 2021), 754 IBD participants who had not previously received the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, underwent blood extraction to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and IBD-related factors. Phase II (May 2021-October 2021) included a subgroup of 52 IBD participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were studied for humoral and cellular response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In Phase I, treatment with anti-TNF was associated with lower rates of seroconversion (aOR 0.25 95% CI [0.10-0.61]). In Phase II, a significant increase in post-vaccination IgG levels was observed regardless of biologic treatment. However, patients treated with anti-TNF exhibited significantly lower IgG levels compared to those without IBD therapy (5.32 ± 2.47 vs. 7.99 ± 2.59 U/ml, p = 0.042). Following vaccination, a lymphocyte, monocyte, and NK cell activation pattern was observed, with no significant differences between patients receiving biologic drugs and those without IBD treatment.

Impact of various high fat diets on gene expression and the microbiome across the mouse intestines.,Dec 2023,"High fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to several diseases including obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In this study, we examined the impact on intestinal gene expression of three isocaloric HFDs that differed only in their fatty acid composition-coconut oil (saturated fats), conventional soybean oil (polyunsaturated fats) and a genetically modified soybean oil (monounsaturated fats). Four functionally distinct segments of the mouse intestinal tract were analyzed using RNA-seq-duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum and proximal colon. We found considerable dysregulation of genes in multiple tissues with the different diets, including those encoding nuclear receptors and genes involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism, epithelial barrier function, IBD and colon cancer as well as genes associated with the microbiome and COVID-19. Network analysis shows that genes involved in metabolism tend to be upregulated by the HFDs while genes related to the immune system are downregulated; neurotransmitter signaling was also dysregulated by the HFDs. Genomic sequencing also revealed a microbiome altered by the HFDs. This study highlights the potential impact of different HFDs on gut health with implications for the organism as a whole and will serve as a reference for gene expression along the length of the intestines.","Martinez-Lomeli, Jose; Deol, Poonamjot; Deans, Jonathan R; Jiang, Tao; Ruegger, Paul; Borneman, James; Sladek, Frances M",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-023-49555-7,38151490,"Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA. pdeol001@ucr.edu.; Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA. pdeol001@ucr.edu.; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Institute of Integrated Genome Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Institute of Integrated Genome Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Institute of Integrated Genome Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.; Institute of Integrated Genome Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38151490,

T cell immune memory after covid-19 and vaccination.,2023,"The T cell memory response is a crucial component of adaptive immunity responsible for limiting or preventing viral reinfection. T cell memory after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or vaccination is broad, and spans multiple viral proteins and epitopes, about 20 in each individual. So far the T cell memory response is long lasting and provides a high level of cross reactivity and hence resistance to viral escape by variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as the omicron variant. All current vaccine regimens tested produce robust T cell memory responses, and heterologous regimens will probably enhance protective responses through increased breadth. T cell memory could have a major role in protecting against severe covid-19 disease through rapid viral clearance and early presentation of epitopes, and the presence of cross reactive T cells might enhance this protection. T cell memory is likely to provide ongoing protection against admission to hospital and death, and the development of a pan-coronovirus vaccine might future proof against new pandemic strains.","Wang, Lulu; Nicols, Alex; Turtle, Lance; Richter, Alex; Duncan, Christopher Ja; Dunachie, Susanna J; Klenerman, Paul; Payne, Rebecca P",BMJ medicine,2754-0413,10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000468,38027416,"Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Immunity and Inflammation Theme, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Immunity and Inflammation Theme, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Tropical and Infectious Disease Unit, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.; Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.; Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Immunity and Inflammation Theme, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.; NDM Centre For Global Health Research, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Mahidol University Faculty of Science, Bangkok, Thailand.; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK.; Translational Gastroenterology Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Immunity and Inflammation Theme, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38027416,

Clinical Utility of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Testing and Defining a Correlate of Protection.,Oct 2023,"Herein, we review established clinical use cases for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measures, which include diagnosis of recent prior infection, isolating high titer convalescent plasma, diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and booster dosing in the immunosuppressed and other populations. We then address whether an antibody correlate of protection (CoP) for SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully defined with the following considerations: Antibody responses in the immunocompetent, vaccine type, variants, use of binding antibody tests vs. neutralization tests, and endpoint measures. In the transition from the COVID-19 pandemic to endemic, there has been much interest in defining an antibody CoP. Due to the high mutability of respiratory viruses and our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants defining a CoP for prevention of infection is unrealistic. However, a CoP may be defined for prevention of severe disease requiring hospitalization and/or death. Most SARS-CoV-2 CoP research has focused on neutralization measurements. However, there can be significant differences in neutralization test methods, and disparate responses to new variants depending on format. Furthermore, neutralization assays are often impractical for high throughput applications (e.g., assessing humoral immune response in populations or large cohorts). Nevertheless, CoP studies using neutralization measures are reviewed to determine where there is consensus. Alternatively, binding antibody tests could be used to define a CoP. Binding antibody assays tend to be highly automatable, high throughput, and therefore practical for large population applications. Again, we review studies for consensus on binding antibody responses to vaccines, focusing on standardized results. Binding antibodies directed against the S1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) of the viral spike protein can provide a practical, indirect measure of neutralization. Initially, a response for S1-RBD antibodies may be selected that reflects the peak response in immunocompetent populations and may serve as a target for booster dosing in the immunocompromised. From existing studies reporting peak S1-RBD responses in standardized units, an approximate range of 1372-2744 BAU/mL for mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines was extracted that could serve as an initial CoP target. This target would need to be confirmed and potentially adjusted for updated vaccines, and almost certainly for other vaccine formats (i.e., viral vector). Alternatively, a threshold or response could be defined based on outcomes over time (i.e., prevention of severe disease).

Development of an impedance-based biosensor for determination of IgG galactosylation levels.,Feb 2024,"The glycan profile of immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule and its changes are associated with a number of different diseases. Galactosylation of IgG was recently suggested as a potential biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and many cancers. In this paper, we propose a portable impedance-based biosensor that utilizes lectin array technology to detect glycans in IgG. Biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia (GSL II) and Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA I) lectins were used in our biosensor design for determination of the ratio of N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) to galactose (Gal) respectively, which is termed agalactosylation factor (AF). Streptavidin gold nanoparticles (GNP) were conjugated to biotinylated lectin bonded to the carbohydrate in the glycoprotein to magnify the change in impedance signal and enhance detection sensitivity. The method was successfully applied to differentiation of the galactosylation levels in human and rat IgG. In addition, we present proof of concept use of our biosensor for differentiation of COVID-19 positive patient samples from negative patients. Consequently, the sensor can be useful in future applications to distinguish between glycan profiles of IgG from healthy and patient samples in disease studies. Our biosensor permits analysis of human serum without conventional time-consuming IgG purification steps or pretreatment using enzyme digestion to cut the sugars from the glycoprotein molecule. The results suggest that the proposed point of care (POC) biosensor can be used for evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy via monitoring changes in the galactosylation profiles of IgG in patients.","Khorshed, Ahmed A; Savchenko, Oleksandra; Liu, Jing; Shoute, Lian; Zeng, Jie; Ren, Shifang; Gu, Jianxing; Jha, Naresh; Yang, Zhong; Wang, Jiucun; Jin, Li; Chen, Jie",Biosensors & bioelectronics,1873-4235,10.1016/j.bios.2023.115793,37984315,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada; Department of Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Sohag University, Sohag, 82524, Egypt.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Key Laboratory of Glycoconjugate Research Ministry of Public Health, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Key Laboratory of Glycoconjugate Research Ministry of Public Health, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Cross-cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Research Unit of Dissecting the Population Genetics and Developing New Technologies for Treatment and Prevention of Skin Phenotypes and Dermatological Diseases (2019RU058), Shanghai, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Research Unit of Dissecting the Population Genetics and Developing New Technologies for Treatment and Prevention of Skin Phenotypes and Dermatological Diseases (2019RU058), Shanghai, China.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada.

The change of healthcare service in Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease during the pandemic: a national multicenter cross-sectional study.,Nov 2023,"The pandemic of COVID-19 was a major public health events and had a deeply impact on the healthcare acquired by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term impacts on healthcare service in Chinese IBD patients under the dynamic zero-COVID strategy. The study was performed in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Care Centers in mainland China in 2021. The data about the healthcare was collected by a 44-item questionnaire. Totally 463 were from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 538 from Crohn's disease (CD) patients were included in the study. The pandemic impacted 37.5% patients on their treatment, and the biggest problem was unable to follow up timely (77.9%). There was a significant increase in healthcare costs in CD (P < 0.001) and no significant change in UC (P = 0.14) after the outbreak. Both UC and CD had an increase in the frequency of outpatient visits (UC 5.07 vs. 4.54, P = 0.001; CD 6.30 vs. 5.76, P = 0.002), and hospitalizations (UC 1.30 vs. 1.02, P < 0.001; CD 3.55 vs. 2.78, P < 0.001). The hospitalization rate in UC reduced slightly (40.2% vs. 42.8%, P = 0.423) after the outbreak, but it significantly increased in CD (75.8% vs. 67.8%, P = 0.004). The rate of biologics had significant increased (UC 11.2% vs. 17.7%, P = 0.005; CD 53.2% vs. 71.0%, P < 0.001). Besides, the proportion of people using telemedicine also increased from 41.6% to 55.1% (P < 0.001). However, 82.8% patients still preferred face-to-face visits. Recurrent outbreaks and the regular pandemic prevention and control policy had a long-term impact on medical care service for IBD patients. The preferred mode of healthcare was still face-to-face visit. It will be a long way to go in the construction of telemedicine in China.","Li, Xiaofei; Wang, Fang; Jia, Yizhen; Zhou, He; Shi, Yanting; Tian, Feng; Chen, Yan; Liang, Jie",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-023-46892-5,37973924,"State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Changle West Road No.169, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Changle West Road No.169, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China.; School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Anzhen Road No.2, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100069, China.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Changle West Road No.169, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Changle West Road No.169, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Sanhao Street No.36, Shenyang, 110004, Liaoning, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jiefang Road No.88, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang, China.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Fourth Military Medical University, Changle West Road No.169, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China. liangjie@fmmu.edu.cn.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37973924,

Clinical Presentation and Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children With COVID-19: A Systematic Review.,Oct 2023,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a relatively new syndrome associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is characterized by a severe clinical course compared to pediatric COVID-19. This review aimed to compile the available evidence on the clinical presentation and management of MIS-C in children with COVID-19. During this systematic review, a comprehensive search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and Scopus, using predetermined search terms, such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords to find relevant studies on the MIS-C. Relevant data were extracted, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using suitable methods. The collected findings were synthesized and discussed in the study. The World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of MIS-C was the most favored due to its precision and inclusiveness. MIS-C primarily affected children aged 6-12 years, with male predominance. MIS-C involves a range of systems, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematologic, mucocutaneous, and respiratory. Radiographic findings revealed cardiovascular abnormalities, solid visceral organ involvement, and bowel abnormalities, reflecting a systemic inflammatory process. Laboratory investigations unveiled elevated inflammatory markers, neutrophil activation, release of extracellular traps in vessels, elevated procalcitonin, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, low hemoglobin, and thrombocytopenia. The inflammatory markers and autoantibody profiles are essential in differentiating MIS-C from COVID-19. The preferred treatment primarily involves immunomodulatory therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), glucocorticoids, and interleukin-6 or 1RA inhibitors or a combination of those. In severe cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mechanical ventilation are necessary, leading to reduced mortality and quick recovery. This review found that the average hospital stay was seven days, and most discharged children fully recovered within seven days. MIS-C is a life-threatening post-COVID-19 condition and involves multiple systems due to systemic inflammation, with elevated inflammation markers. Recognition of multisystem involvement is crucial, and prompt identification and multidisciplinary treatment are vital for optimal outcomes.","Albanji, Mohammed H; Baghafar, Ahmed A; Alghanmi, Yasser A; Shaaban, Mohammed M; Alkashlan, Ebrahim A; Sende, Haifa H; Alzahrani, Mofareh S; Filfilan, Nuha N",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.46918,37954764,"Pediatric Neurology, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Pediatrics, Royal Commission Medical Center, Yanbu, SAU.; Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine, Taif University, Taif, SAU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37954764,
Cannabidiol - Help and hype in targeting mucosal diseases.,Jan 2024,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the most commonly utilised phytocannabinoids due to its non-psychoactive and multiple potential therapeutic properties and its non-selective pharmacology. Recent studies have demonstrated efficacy of CBD in some types of drug resistant epilepsies in combination with other therapies; comparative efficacy to other agents or placebo has been hoped for anxiety, chronic pain, and inflammatory disorders based on animal data. Although CBD products are generally treated as a restricted substance, these are being eased, partially in response to significant growth in CBD product usage and increased production but more due to emerging evidence about its safety and pharmacological properties. Currently, only one CBD product (Epidiolex®) has been approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and US Food and Drug Administration. CBD has demonstrated promise in alleviating gut and lung diseases in vitro; however, its physicochemical properties pose a significant barrier to achieving pharmacological effects in in vivo and clinical trials. Improving CBD formulations and delivery methods using technologies including self-emulsifying emulsion, nano and micro particles could overcome these shortfalls and improve its efficacy. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of CBD in gastrointestinal and lung diseases from the available in vitro, in vivo, and clinical research.

Burnout in healthcare - the Emperor's New Clothes.,2023,"Burnout is common among physicians; it severely alters their health and has a negative impact on functioning of healthcare systems. Hypertension, increased cortisol levels, maladaptive behaviors with negative social consequences, and suboptimal quality of care have been associated with healthcare providers' burnout. As the number of patients with cancers, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders will rise, we need new solutions to maintain physicians' health and, therefore, quality of care. Coping strategies before the COVID-19 pandemic seem ineffective in scaling all the deficits of the global healthcare systems. Examples of new initiatives include new collaborative projects, such as COH-FIT (The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times - https://www.coh-fit.com), which aims to collect global data and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in order to identify various coping strategies for patients and healthcare workers during infection times, or MEMO (Minimizing Error, Maximizing Outcome), funded by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Others: i) Rome Foundation GastroPsych undertake efforts dedicated to the science and practice of psychogastroenterology, a burgeoning field with roots in behavioral intervention, cognitive science and experimental psychology focused on fostering the professional growth and collaboration of those engaged in medical practices, or ii) World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), Train The Trainers (TTT) program including a new topic of the impact of burnout on career longevity in order to foster strategies for staying healthy and increasing career satisfaction.

Perceptions of and Experiences with the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Jun 2024,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased feelings of emotional distress and disruptions in care across diverse patients subgroups, including those with chronic medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We sought to understand the impact of the pandemic on the physical and emotional well-being of individuals with IBD and concurrent depression and/or anxiety symptoms. We conducted qualitative interviews after the beginning of the pandemic with 46 adults with IBD. Participants reported increased levels of emotional distress, feelings of social isolation, and uncertainty over whether IBD medications put them at increased risk. Young adults discussed feeling as if their lives had been disrupted. In addition, several individuals demonstrated resiliency and emphasized positives about the pandemic, including increased connectivity with family and friends, the convenience of being able to work from home despite their IBD symptoms, and lessened feelings of ""missing out."" Our findings highlight several opportunities to improve the health and well-being of individuals with IBD and beyond including increased support for combatting social isolation, enhanced counseling about medication risks and benefits, and the incorporation of resiliency skills building.","Taylor, Ashley L; Kogan, Jane; Meyers, Jessica; Lupe, Stephen; Click, Benjamin; Cohen, Benjamin; Szigethy, Eva; Keefer, Laurie; Nikolajski, Cara",Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,1573-3572,10.1007/s10880-023-09979-9,37932518,"UPMC Center for High-Value Health Care, UPMC Insurance Services Division, U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant St., 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. taylora29@upmc.edu.; UPMC Center for High-Value Health Care, UPMC Insurance Services Division, U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant St., 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; UPMC Center for High-Value Health Care, UPMC Insurance Services Division, U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant St., 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.; Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York City, NY, USA.; UPMC Center for High-Value Health Care, UPMC Insurance Services Division, U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant St., 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37932518,
"Selectivity, efficacy and safety of JAKinibs: new evidence for a still evolving story.",Jan 2024,"Fundamental insight gained over the last decades led to the discovery of cytokines as pivotal drivers of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis/psoriasis arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, atopic dermatitis and spondylarthritis. A deeper understanding of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of various cytokines has prompted new cytokine-targeting therapies, which revolutionised the treatment options in the last years for patients with inflammatory disorders. Disease-associated immune responses typically involve a complex interplay of multiple cytokines. Therefore, blockade of one single cytokine does not necessarily lead to a persistent remission in all patients with inflammatory disorders and fostered new therapeutic strategies targeting intracellular pathways shared by multiple cytokines. By inhibiting JAK-STAT signalling pathways common to families of cytokines, JAK-inhibitors (JAKinibs) have created a new paradigm for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Multiple agents have been approved for various disorders and more are being investigated for several new indications. Second-generation selective JAKinibs have been devised with the aim to achieve an increased selectivity and a possible reduced risk of side effects. In the current review, we will summarise the current body of evidence of pan versus selective JAKinibs and the most recent insights on new side effects and indications, including COVID-19.","Bonelli, Michael; Kerschbaumer, Andreas; Kastrati, Kastriot; Ghoreschi, Kamran; Gadina, Massimo; Heinz, Leonhard X; Smolen, Josef S; Aletaha, Daniel; O'Shea, John; Laurence, Arian",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,1468-2060,10.1136/ard-2023-223850,37923366,"Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria michael.bonelli@meduniwien.ac.at.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.; Molecular Immunology and Inflammation Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Molecular Immunology and Inflammation Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, UCLH Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37923366,

COVID-19 Immunization Rates in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Worldwide: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Sep 2023,"Individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are characterized by an increased vulnerability to complications stemming from infectious diseases. While these patients do not inherently face a heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, their vulnerability to severe COVID-19 complications and subsequent hospitalization is notably increased. The objective of our study is to quantitatively assess the global coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among individuals with IBD, achieved through a comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review. Thirteen studies were systematically selected from scientific articles available in the MEDLINE/PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases, spanning from 1 January 2021 to 25 July 2023. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine uptake was estimated at 72% (95%CI = 59-83%) for at least one dose, 81% (95%CI = 68-91%) for the complete vaccination regimen, and 71% (95%CI = 46-91%) for the third dose. Analysis of the determinants influencing vaccination uptake revealed several significant associations. These encompassed Caucasian ethnicity, female sex, absence of immunosuppressive therapy, advanced age, prior receipt of the anti-influenza vaccine, absence of a history of COVID-19 infection, and the provision of advice from gastroenterologists, all linked to improved compliance. Our study underscores a noteworthy yet not entirely optimal COVID-19 vaccination coverage among individuals with IBD. A multifaceted approach is warranted to enhance vaccination rates. Within this context, the role of gastroenterologists extends beyond direct patient care, encompassing a pivotal responsibility in preventing complications stemming from post-infectious diseases.","Bianchi, Francesco Paolo; Donghia, Rossella; Tatoli, Rossella; Bonfiglio, Caterina",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines11101523,37896927,"Epidemiology Unit, Bari Policlinico General Hospital, 70124 Bari, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, IRCCS S.

Therapeutic Potential of Cannabis: A Comprehensive Review of Current and Future Applications.,Sep 2023,"Historically, cannabis has been valued for its pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and calming properties. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese medicines recognized their therapeutic potential. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system, which interacts with cannabis phytoconstituents, has scientifically explained how cannabis affects the human immune system, including the central nervous system (CNS). This review explores the evolving world of cannabis-based treatments, spotlighting its diverse applications. By researching current research and clinical studies, we probe into how cannabinoids like Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) help to manage conditions ranging from chronic pain, persistent inflammation, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders to even viral diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS-CoV-2. and the emerging monkeypox. The long-term recreational use of cannabis can develop into cannabis use disorder (CUD), and therefore, understanding the factors contributing to the development and maintenance of cannabis addiction, including genetic predisposition, neurobiological mechanisms, and environmental influences, will be timely. Shedding light on the adverse impacts of CUD underscores the importance of early intervention, effective treatment approaches, and public health initiatives to address this complex issue in an evolving landscape of cannabis policies and perceptions.","Leinen, Zach J; Mohan, Rahul; Premadasa, Lakmini S; Acharya, Arpan; Mohan, Mahesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Biomedicines,2227-9059,10.3390/biomedicines11102630,37893004,"Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68182, USA.; Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68182, USA.; Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227, USA.; Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68182, USA.; Southwest National Primate Research Center, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227, USA.; Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68182, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37893004,

Impact of Various High Fat Diets on Gene Expression and the Microbiome Across the Mouse Intestines.,Oct 2023,"High fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to several diseases including obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In this study, we examined the impact on intestinal gene expression of three isocaloric HFDs that differed only in their fatty acid composition - coconut oil (saturated fats), conventional soybean oil (polyunsaturated fats) and a genetically modified soybean oil (monounsaturated fats). Four functionally distinct segments of the mouse intestinal tract were analyzed using RNA-seq - duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum and proximal colon. We found considerable dysregulation of genes in multiple tissues with the different diets, including those encoding nuclear receptors and genes involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism, epithelial barrier function, IBD and colon cancer as well as genes associated with the microbiome and COVID-19. Network analysis shows that genes involved in metabolism tend to be upregulated by the HFDs while genes related to the immune system are downregulated; neurotransmitter signaling was also dysregulated by the HFDs. Genomic sequencing also revealed a microbiome altered by the HFDs. This study highlights the potential impact of different HFDs on gut health with implications for the organism as a whole and will serve as a reference for gene expression along the length of the intestines.","Martinez-Lomeli, Jose; Deol, Poonamjot; Deans, Jonathan R; Jiang, Tao; Ruegger, Paul; Borneman, James; Sladek, Frances M",Research square,2693-5015,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3401763/v1,37886485,"University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.; University of California, Riverside.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37886485,
Fungal microbiota sustains lasting immune activation of neutrophils and their progenitors in severe COVID-19.,Nov 2023,"Gastrointestinal fungal dysbiosis is a hallmark of several diseases marked by systemic immune activation. Whether persistent pathobiont colonization during immune alterations and impaired gut barrier function has a durable impact on host immunity is unknown. We found that elevated levels of Candida albicans immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies marked patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) who had intestinal Candida overgrowth, mycobiota dysbiosis and systemic neutrophilia. Analysis of hematopoietic stem cell progenitors in sCOVID-19 revealed transcriptional changes in antifungal immunity pathways and reprogramming of granulocyte myeloid progenitors (GMPs) for up to a year. Mice colonized with C. albicans patient isolates experienced increased lung neutrophilia and pulmonary NETosis during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, which were partially resolved with antifungal treatment or by interleukin-6 receptor blockade. sCOVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab experienced sustained reductions in C. albicans IgG antibodies titers and GMP transcriptional changes. These findings suggest that gut fungal pathobionts may contribute to immune activation during inflammatory diseases, offering potential mycobiota-immune therapeutic strategies for sCOVID-19 with prolonged symptoms.","Kusakabe, Takato; Lin, Woan-Yu; Cheong, Jin-Gyu; Singh, Gagandeep; Ravishankar, Arjun; Yeung, Stephen T; Mesko, Marissa; DeCelie, Meghan Bialt; Carriche, Guilhermina; Zhao, Zhen; Rand, Sophie; Doron, Itai; Putzel, Gregory G; Worgall, Stefan; Cushing, Melissa; Westblade, Lars; Inghirami, Giorgio; Parkhurst, Christopher N; Guo, Chun-Jun; Schotsaert, Michael; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Josefowicz, Steven Z; Salvatore, Mirella; Iliev, Iliyan D",Nature immunology,1529-2916,10.1038/s41590-023-01637-4,37872315,"Joan and Sanford I.

The clinical relevance of OSM in inflammatory diseases: a comprehensive review.,2023,"Oncostatin M (OSM) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in a variety of inflammatory responses such as wound healing, liver regeneration, and bone remodeling. As a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, OSM binds the shared receptor gp130, recruits either OSMRβ or LIFRβ, and activates a variety of signaling pathways including the JAK/STAT, MAPK, JNK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. Since its discovery in 1986, OSM has been identified as a significant contributor to a multitude of inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, lung and skin disease, cardiovascular disease, and most recently, COVID-19. Additionally, OSM has also been extensively studied in the context of several cancer types including breast, cervical, ovarian, testicular, colon and gastrointestinal, brain,lung, skin, as well as other cancers. While OSM has been recognized as a significant contributor for each of these diseases, and studies have shown OSM inhibition is effective at treating or reducing symptoms, very few therapeutics have succeeded into clinical trials, and none have yet been approved by the FDA for treatment. In this review, we outline the role OSM plays in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including cancer, and outline the previous and current strategies for developing an inhibitor for OSM signaling.","Wolf, Cody L; Pruett, Clyde; Lighter, Darren; Jorcyk, Cheryl L",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1239732,37841259,"Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.; Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.; Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.; Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.; Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37841259,
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyle and Psychosocial Behavior of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Narrative Review.,Sep 2023,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a considerable impact on the global healthcare system and potentially the clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although IBD is a chronic disease, its therapy (except steroid therapy) does not increase the risk of contracting or aggravating COVID-19. However, the clinical course of patients is significantly influenced by environmental factors. Social restrictions due to the pandemic or the fear of contracting the virus have influenced lifestyle and psychosocial behaviors that may worsen the clinical course of patients with IBD. This narrative literature review summarizes the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lifestyle and psychosocial behaviors of patients with IBD. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the lifestyle and psychosocial behaviors of patients with IBD. Furthermore, patients with IBD failed to maintain medication adherence, thus affecting the clinical course of their condition.","Nishida, Yu; Hosomi, Shuhei; Kobayashi, Yumie; Nakata, Rieko; Ominami, Masaki; Nadatani, Yuji; Fukunaga, Shusei; Otani, Koji; Tanaka, Fumio; Nagami, Yasuaki; Taira, Koichi; Kamata, Noriko; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2227-9032,10.3390/healthcare11192642,37830679,"Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University Osaka, Osaka 530-0001, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37830679,

Disease Flares Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Dec 2023,"Objective Flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can occur infrequently after vaccination for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although the details of this phenomenon are poorly understood. To clarify the possibility of an unfavorable response in patients with IBD, we investigated IBD-related symptoms during the COVID-19 vaccination. Methods Between October 2021 and February 2022, we obtained the COVID-19 vaccination status of 411 IBD patients who were being treated at our institution. The disease course of IBD after vaccination was investigated in 188 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 119 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who had received at least one dose of the vaccine during the clinical remission phase. The baseline characteristics before vaccination were compared between the patients with UC with or without disease flares. Results During the 30-day follow-up period, eight patients with UC (4.3%) and one patient with CD (0.8%) experienced disease flares following vaccination. Disease flares occurred after the first vaccination in six patients and after the second vaccination in three patients. As for the timing of onset of disease flares, eight events (88.9%) occurred within one week of vaccination. Two patients required hospitalization, and one patient with CD required surgery for an intra-abdominal abscess. The baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between patients with UC who experienced flares and those who did not. Conclusion IBD flares following COVID-19 vaccination are rare and vaccination should therefore be recommended for patients with IBD. However, the possibility of disease flares should be considered for approximately one week after each vaccination, especially in patients with UC.","Yoshida, Yuichiro; Fujioka, Shin; Moriyama, Tomohiko; Umeno, Junji; Kawasaki, Keisuke; Fuyuno, Yuta; Matsuno, Yuichi; Ihara, Yutaro; Torisu, Takehiro; Kitazono, Takanari","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",1349-7235,10.2169/internalmedicine.2335-23,37779068,"Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Endoscopic Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Kyushu University Hospital, Japan.; International Medical Department, Kyushu University Hospital, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.; Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37779068,

A Paratope-Enhanced Method to Determine Breadth and Depth TCR Clonal Metrics of the Private Human T-Cell Vaccine Response after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.,Sep 2023,"Quantitative metrics for vaccine-induced T-cell responses are an important need for developing correlates of protection and their use in vaccine-based medical management and population health. Molecular TCR analysis is an appealing strategy but currently requires a targeted methodology involving complex integration of ex vivo data (antigen-specific functional T-cell cytokine responses and TCR molecular responses) that uncover only public antigen-specific metrics. Here, we describe an untargeted private TCR method that measures breadth and depth metrics of the T-cell response to vaccine challenge using a simple pre- and post-vaccine subject sampling, TCR immunoseq analysis, and a bioinformatic approach using self-organizing maps and GLIPH2. Among 515 subjects undergoing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, we found that breadth and depth metrics were moderately correlated between the targeted public TCR response and untargeted private TCR response methods. The untargeted private TCR method was sufficiently sensitive to distinguish subgroups of potential clinical significance also observed using public TCR methods (the reduced T-cell vaccine response with age and the paradoxically elevated T-cell vaccine response of patients on anti-TNF immunotherapy). These observations suggest the promise of this untargeted private TCR method to produce T-cell vaccine-response metrics in an antigen-agnostic and individual-autonomous context.","Li, Dalin; Pavlovitch-Bedzyk, Ana Jimena; Ebinger, Joseph E; Khan, Abdul; Hamideh, Mohamed; Merchant, Akil; Figueiredo, Jane C; Cheng, Susan; Davis, Mark M; McGovern, Dermot P B; Melmed, Gil Y; Xu, Alexander M; Braun, Jonathan",International journal of molecular sciences,1422-0067,10.3390/ijms241814223,37762524,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Computational and Systems Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer and Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer and Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Computational and Systems Immunology Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer and Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Institute, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37762524,

Unravelling the immunobiology of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs): Implications in health and disease.,Dec 2023,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), a growing class of immune cells, imitate the appearance and abilities of T cells. However, unlike T cells, ILCs lack acquired antigen receptors, and they also do not undergo clonal selection or proliferation in response to antigenic stimuli. Despite lacking antigen-specific receptors, ILCs respond quickly to signals from infected or damaged tissues and generate an array of cytokines that regulate the development of adaptive immune response. ILCs can be categorized into four types based on their signature cytokines and transcription factors: ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 (including Lymphoid Tissue inducer- LTi cells), and regulatory ILCs (ILCregs). ILCs play key functions in controlling and resolving inflammation, and variations in their proportion are linked to various pathological diseases including cancer, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and skin diseases. We highlight current advancements in the biology and classification of ILCs in this review. Additionally, we provide a thorough overview of their contributions to several inflammatory bone-related pathologies, including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Understanding the multiple functions of ILCs in both physiological and pathological conditions will further mobilize future research towards targeting ILCs for therapeutic purposes.","Srivastava, Rupesh K; Sapra, Leena; Bhardwaj, Asha; Mishra, Pradyumna K; Verma, Bhupendra; Baig, Zainab",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,1879-0305,10.1016/j.cytogfr.2023.09.002,37743134,"Translational Immunology, Osteoimmunology & Immunoporosis Lab (TIOIL), Department of Biotechnology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi 110029, India.

The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Executive Summary.,Sep 2023,"The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (i.e., associated direct and indirect costs, prevalence of disease, personal impact to the individual and to caregivers) continues to increase in Canada. The prevalence of IBD has increased since Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2018 Impact of IBD report from an estimated 270,000 Canadians living with IBD in 2018 to an estimated 322,600 Canadians living with IBD today in 2023. Consequently, associated costs of IBD have also dramatically increased from an estimated $2.57 billion in 2018 to an estimated $5.38 billion in 2023; this increase is due to multiple factors including increased prevalence of disease, inflation, and additional identified factors (e.g., presenteeism, costs of childcare). Beyond the economic impact of IBD, these diseases have a significant impact on people living with the disease and their caregivers, including different presentations of disease, different commonly associated extra-intestinal manifestations or comorbid conditions, and different barriers to accessing care. In this supplementary issue, we review: Evolving trends in the epidemiology of IBD; updated estimates of indirect and direct costs (including out-of-pocket costs) associated with IBD; information specific to IBD in children, adolescents, and seniors; issues related to IBD pertaining to sex and gender; information specific to risks associated with COVID-19 and cancer related to IBD; an overview of current treatments for IBD; and evolving care models, including access to care.","Windsor, Joseph W; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Murthy, Sanjay K; Bitton, Alain; Bernstein, Charles N; Jones, Jennifer L; Lee, Kate; Targownik, Laura E; Peña-Sánchez, Juan-Nicolás; Rohatinsky, Noelle; Ghandeharian, Sara; Im, James H B; Davis, Tal; Weinstein, Jake; Goddard, Quinn; Benchimol, Eric I; Kaplan, Gilaad G",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwad003,37674500,"Departments of Medicine and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; The Ottawa Hospital IBD Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, McGill University Health Centre IBD Centre, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Departments of Medicine, Clinical Health, and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.; College of Nursing, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Departments of Medicine and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Departments of Medicine and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37674500,
The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Access to and Models of Care.,Sep 2023,"Rising compounding prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Kaplan GG, Windsor JW. The four epidemiological stages in the global evolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2021;18:56-66.) and pandemic-exacerbated health system resource limitations have resulted in significant variability in access to high-quality, evidence-based, person-centered specialty care for Canadians living with IBD. Individuals with IBD have identified long wait times, gaps in biopsychosocial care, treatment and travel expenses, and geographic and provider variation in IBD specialty care and knowledge as some of the key barriers to access. Care delivered within integrated models of care (IMC) has shown promise related to impact on disease-related outcomes and quality of life. However, access to these models is limited within the Canadian healthcare systems and much remains to be learned about the most appropriate IMC team composition and roles. Although eHealth technologies have been leveraged to overcome some access challenges since COVID-19, more research is needed to understand how best to integrate eHealth modalities (i.e., video or telephone visits) into routine IBD care. Many individuals with IBD are satisfied with these eHealth modalities. However, not all disease assessment and monitoring can be achieved through virtual modalities. The need for access to person-centered, objective disease monitoring strategies, inclusive of point of care intestinal ultrasound, is more pressing than ever given pandemic-exacerbated restrictions in access to endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. Supporting learning healthcare systems for IBD and research relating to the strategic use of innovative and integrative implementation strategies for evidence-based IBD care interventions are greatly needed. Data derived from this research will be essential to appropriately allocating scarce resources aimed at improving person-centred access to cost-effective IBD care.","Mathias, Holly; Rohatinsky, Noelle;

The 2023 Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: COVID-19 and IBD.,Sep 2023,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a monumental impact on the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) community. At the beginning of the pandemic, knowledge on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on IBD was lacking, especially in those with medication-suppressed immune systems. Throughout the pandemic, scientific literature exponentially expanded, resulting in clinical guidance and vaccine recommendations for individuals with IBD. Crohn's and Colitis Canada established the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to process and communicate rapidly transforming knowledge into guidance for individuals with IBD and their caregivers, healthcare providers, and policy makers. Recommendations at the onset of the pandemic were based on conjecture from experience of prior viruses, with a precautionary principle in mind. We now know that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in those with IBD is the same as the general population. As with healthy populations, advanced age and comorbidities increase the risk for severe COVID-19. Individuals with IBD who are actively flaring and/or who require high doses of prednisone are susceptible to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, sustaining maintenance therapies (e.g., biologics) is recommended. A three-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen in those with IBD produces a robust antibody response with a similar adverse event profile as the general population. Breakthrough infections following vaccine have been observed, particularly as the virus continues to evolve, which supports receiving a bivalent vaccine booster. Limited data exist on the impact of IBD and its therapies on long-term outcomes following COVID-19. Ongoing research is necessary to address new concerns manifesting in those with IBD throughout the evolving pandemic.","Kaplan, Gilaad G; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Windsor, Joseph W; Bernstein, Charles N; Bitton, Alain;

"A prospective longitudinal cohort study on risk factors for COVID-19 vaccination failure (RisCoin): methods, procedures and characterization of the cohort.",Dec 2023,"The primary objective of the RisCoin study was to investigate the interplay of genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors as well as stress levels on influencing the humoral immune response after at least two COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily with mRNAs, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections during follow-up. Here, we describe the study design, procedures, and study population. RisCoin is a prospective, monocentric, longitudinal, observational cohort study. Between October and December 2021, 4515 participants with at least two COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, were enrolled at the LMU University Hospital of Munich, thereof > 4000 healthcare workers (HCW), 180 patients with inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppression, and 119 patients with mental disorders. At enrollment, blood and saliva samples were collected to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, their neutralizing capacity against Omicron-BA.1, stress markers, metabolomics, and genetics. To ensure the confidential handling of sensitive data of study participants, we developed a data protection concept and a mobile application for two-way communication. The application allowed continuous data reporting, including breakthrough infections by the participants, despite irreversible anonymization. Up to 1500 participants attended follow-up visits every two to six months after enrollment. The study gathered comprehensive data and bio-samples of a large representative HCW cohort and two patient groups allowing analyses of complex interactions. Our data protection concept combined with the mobile application proves the feasibility of longitudinal assessment of anonymized participants.

A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Persistent Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Incidence of New Gastrointestinal Illness after Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,Jul 2023,"It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in gastrointestinal symptoms. For some, these symptoms may persist beyond acute infection, in what is known as 'post-COVID syndrome'. We conducted a systematic review to examine the prevalence of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and the incidence of new gastrointestinal illnesses following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched the scientific literature using MedLine, SCOPUS, Europe PubMed Central and medRxiv from December 2019 to July 2023. Two reviewers independently identified 45 eligible articles, which followed participants for various gastrointestinal outcomes after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. The weighted pooled prevalence for persistent gastrointestinal symptoms of any nature and duration was 10.8% compared with 4.9% in healthy controls. For seven studies at low risk of methodological bias, the symptom prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 24.1%, with a median follow-up time of 18 weeks. We also identified a higher risk for future illnesses such as irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, hepatic and biliary disease, liver disease and autoimmune-mediated illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease in historically SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals. Our review has shown that, from a limited pool of mostly low-quality studies, previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure may be associated with ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms and the development of functional gastrointestinal illness. Furthermore, we show the need for high-quality research to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 association with gastrointestinal illness, particularly as population exposure to enteric infections returns to pre-COVID-19-restriction levels.","Hawkings, Michael J; Vaselli, Natasha Marcella; Charalampopoulos, Dimitrios; Brierley, Liam; Elliot, Alex J; Buchan, Iain; Hungerford, Daniel",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v15081625,37631968,"Department of Public Health, Policy & Systems, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GF, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection, Veterinary & Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; Department of Public Health, Policy & Systems, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GF, UK.; Department of Health Data Science, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GF, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; Real-Time Syndromic Surveillance Team, Field Services, Health Protection Operations, UK Health Security Agency, Birmingham B2 4BH, UK.; Department of Public Health, Policy & Systems, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GF, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.; Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection, Veterinary & Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7BE, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37631968,

Glucocorticoids regulate lipid mediator networks by reciprocal modulation of 15-lipoxygenase isoforms affecting inflammation resolution.,Aug 2023,"Glucocorticoids (GC) are potent anti-inflammatory agents, broadly used to treat acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g., critically ill COVID-19 patients or patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. GC not only limit inflammation but also promote its resolution although the underlying mechanisms are obscure. Here, we reveal reciprocal regulation of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) isoform expression in human monocyte/macrophage lineages by GC with respective consequences for the biosynthesis of specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) and their 15-LOX-derived monohydroxylated precursors (mono-15-OH). Dexamethasone robustly up-regulated pre-mRNA, mRNA, and protein levels of ALOX15B/15-LOX-2 in blood monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) phenotypes, causing elevated SPM and mono-15-OH production in inflammatory cell types. In sharp contrast, dexamethasone blocked ALOX15/15-LOX-1 expression and impaired SPM formation in proresolving M2-MDM. These dexamethasone actions were mimicked by prednisolone and hydrocortisone but not by progesterone, and they were counteracted by the GC receptor (GR) antagonist RU486. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed robust GR recruitment to a putative enhancer region within intron 3 of the ALOX15B gene but not to the transcription start site. Knockdown of 15-LOX-2 in M1-MDM abolished GC-induced SPM formation and mono-15-OH production. Finally, ALOX15B/15-LOX-2 upregulation was evident in human monocytes from patients with GC-treated COVID-19 or patients with IBD. Our findings may explain the proresolving GC actions and offer opportunities for optimizing GC pharmacotherapy and proresolving mediator production.","Rao, Zhigang; Brunner, Elena; Giszas, Benjamin; Iyer-Bierhoff, Aishwarya; Gerstmeier, Jana; Börner, Friedemann; Jordan, Paul M; Pace, Simona; Meyer, Katharina P L; Hofstetter, Robert K; Merk, Daniel; Paulenz, Christian; Heinzel, Thorsten; Grunert, Philip C; Stallmach, Andreas; Serhan, Charles N; Werner, Markus; Werz, Oliver",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1091-6490,10.1073/pnas.2302070120,37603745,"Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine IV (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Infectious Diseases), Jena University Hospital, Jena 07747, Germany.; Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Jena 07745, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität München, Munich 81377, Germany.; Analytik Jena AG, Jena 07745, Germany.; Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Jena 07745, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine IV (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Infectious Diseases), Jena University Hospital, Jena 07747, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine IV (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Infectious Diseases), Jena University Hospital, Jena 07747, Germany.; Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesia, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.; Department of Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena D-07743, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37603745,

Intra-host variation in the spike S1/S2 region of a feline coronavirus type-1 in a cat with persistent infection.,Aug 2023,"Feline coronavirus type 1 (FCoV-1) is widely known for causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic infection that is often fatal, with the virus known as the FIPV biotype. However, subclinical disease also occurs, in which cats may not show signs and intermittently shed the virus, including in feces, possibly for long periods of time. This virus is known as the FECV biotype. Progression of FECV to FIPV has been linked to several genomic changes, however a specific region of the viral spike protein at the interface of the spike S1 and S2 domains has been especially implicated. In this study, we followed a cat (#576) for six years from 2017, at which time FCoV-1 was detected in feces and conjunctival swabs, until 2022, when the animal was euthanized based on a diagnosis of alimentary small cell lymphoma. Over this time period, the cat was clinically diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic rhinitis, and cardiac problems were also suspected. Using hybridization capture targeting the spike (S) gene of FCoV followed by next-generation sequencing, we screened 27 clinical samples. We detected FCoV-1 in 4 samples taken in 2017 (intestine and nasal tissue, feces, and conjunctiva), and 3 samples taken in 2022 (feces, and intestinal and heart tissue), but not in fecal samples taken in 2019 and 2020. Next, we focused on the S1/S2 region within S, which contains the furin cleavage site (FCS), a key regulator of viral transmission and pathogenesis. We show that the FCoV-1 variants obtained from feces in 2017 and 2022 were identical, while the ones from conjunctiva (2017), heart (2022), and intestine (2017 and 2022) were distinct. Sequence comparison of all the variants obtained showed that most of the non-synonymous changes in the S1/S2 region occur within the FCS. In the heart, we found two variants that differed by a single nucleotide, resulting in distinct FCS motifs that differ in one amino acid. It is predicted that one of these FCS motifs will down-regulate spike cleavability. The variant from the conjunctiva (2017) had a 6-nucleotide in-frame insertion that resulted in a longer and more exposed S1/S2 loop, which is predicted to be more accessible to the furin protease. Our studies indicate that FCoV-1 can independently persist in the gastrointestinal tract and heart of a cat over a long period of time without evidence of typical FIP signs, with intermittent viral shedding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.","Olarte-Castillo, Ximena A; Licitra, Beth N; André, Nicole M; Sierra, Maria A; Mason, Christopher E; Goodman, Laura B; Whittaker, Gary R",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2692-8205,10.1101/2023.07.31.551356,37577589,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37577589,

Whipple's Disease; An Overlooked Diagnosis.,Apr 2023,"Whipple disease is a rare multisystem inflammatory disease. Because fewer than 1000 reported cases have been described, clinical experience with this disorder is sparse. We are reporting a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with fever, weight loss, and polyarthralgia for 2 months, and 1 month of diarrhea. The patient was thoroughly investigated for collagen diseases and COVID-19, with no definite diagnosis. A therapeutic trial by immunosuppressive drugs provided partial remission followed by a marked rebound of the symptoms. His occult blood in stool was positive and subsequent upper endoscopy with proximal small intestinal biopsies showed the pathological features of Whipple's disease. The patient showed a dramatic improvement following treatment with ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Despite the rarity of Whipple's disease, its course mimics many rheumatological diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and COVID-19 disease.

Susceptibility to COVID-19 and Immunologic Response to Vaccination in Patients With Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,Aug 2023,"Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a highly heterogeneous group of diseases that share a common etiology of immune dysregulation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, among others. It is estimated that the prevalence of IMIDs ranges between 5% and 7% in developed countries. As current management of IMIDs includes the use of immunomodulatory medications, the resulting weakened immune response can increase the risk of infection, including with SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) and reduce response to vaccination, placing these individuals at continued risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. In this article, we summarize the current literature related to COVID-19 outcomes and the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among patients with rheumatologically dominated IMIDs, as well as the effect of immunomodulatory therapies on these outcomes.

Serologic Response and Safety after a Third Dose of the COVID-19 BNT162b2 Vaccine in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,Jul 2023,"Vaccines are pivotal for control of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have lower serologic response after two COVID-19 vaccine doses. Data regarding a third vaccine dose are scarce. An Israeli multicenter prospective observational study recruited 319 subjects: 220 with IBD (79 treated with anti-TNFα) and 99 healthy control (HC) participants. All patients received two mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech), 80% of whom received a third vaccine dose. Evaluation included disease activity, anti-spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antibody levels, anti-TNFα drug levels, and adverse events (AEs). All participants showed significant serologic response one month after receiving a third dose. However, three months later, the anti-S levels decreased significantly in patients treated with anti-TNFα compared with the non-anti-TNFα and HC groups. A correlation between serologic response to the third vaccine dose and anti-TNF drug levels was not found. No significant AE or IBD exacerbation was observed. Importantly, lower serologic response after the third vaccine dose predicted infection. A third dose of BNT162b2 is effective and safe in patients with IBD. Lower serologic response predicted infection, even in seropositive subjects. Lower serologic responses and their rapid decline suggest a fourth vaccine dose in this patient population.","Edelman-Klapper, Hadar; Rabinowitz, Keren Masha; Zittan, Eran; Bar-Gil Shitrit, Ariella; Goren, Idan; Avni-Biron, Irit; Ollech, Jacob E; Lichtenstein, Lev; Banai-Eran, Hagar; Yanai, Henit; Snir, Yifat; Pauker, Maor H; Friedenberg, Adi; Levy-Barda, Adva; Broitman, Yelena; Ben Zvi, Haim; Perets, Tsachi-Tsadok; Eliakim, Rami; Barkan, Revital; Goren, Sophy; Cohen, Dani; Dotan, Iris; ,",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines11071263,37515078,"Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; The Abraham and Sonia Rochlin IBD Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, HaEmek Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Israel Institute of Technology, Afula 1834111, Israel.; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3109601, Israel.; IBD MOM Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Digestive Diseases Institute, Jerusalem 9103102, Israel.; Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9112102, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Clalit Health Services, Petah Tikva 4933355, Israel.; Adelson School of Medicine, Ariel University, Ariel 4077625, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Biobank, Rabin Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Microbiology Laboratory, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Gastroenterology Laboratory, Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Holon Institute of Technology, Department of Digital Medical Technologies, Holon 5810201, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Department of Gastroenterology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 52621, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; School of Public Health, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva 4941492, Israel.; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37515078,

Managing Cardiovascular and Cancer Risk Associated with JAK Inhibitors.,Nov 2023,"Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have enormous appeal as immune-modulating therapies across many chronic inflammatory diseases, but recently this promise has been overshadowed by questions regarding associated cardiovascular and cancer risk emerging from the ORAL Surveillance phase 3b/4 post-marketing requirement randomized controlled trial. In that study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with existing cardiovascular risk, tofacitinib, the first JAKi registered for chronic inflammatory disease, failed to meet non-inferiority thresholds when compared with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for both incident major adverse cardiovascular events and incident cancer. While this result was unexpected by many, subsequently published observational data have also supported this finding. Notably, however, such a risk has largely not yet been demonstrated in patients outside the specific clinical situation examined in the trial, even in the face of many studies examining this. Nevertheless, this signal has practically re-aligned approaches to both tofacitinib and other JAKi to varying extents, in other patient populations and contexts: within rheumatoid arthritis, but also in psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, and beyond. Application to individual patients can be more challenging but remains important to harness the substantive potential of JAKi to the maximum extent safely possible. This review not only explores the evolution of the regulatory response to the signal, its informing data, biological plausibility, and its impact on guidelines, but also the many factors that clinicians must consider in navigating cardiovascular and cancer risk for their patients considering JAKi as immune-modulating therapy.","Yang, Victor; Kragstrup, Tue W; McMaster, Christopher; Reid, Pankti; Singh, Namrata; Haysen, Stine R; Robinson, Philip C; Liew, David F L",Drug safety,1179-1942,10.1007/s40264-023-01333-0,37490213,"Department of Rheumatology, Level 1, North Wing, Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Austin Health, 300 Waterdale Road, PO Box 5444, Heidelberg West, VIC, 3081, Australia.; Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Sector for Rheumatology, Diagnostic Center, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, Silkeborg, Denmark.; Department of Rheumatology, Level 1, North Wing, Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Austin Health, 300 Waterdale Road, PO Box 5444, Heidelberg West, VIC, 3081, Australia.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Austin Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Centre for Digital Transformation of Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Division of Rheumatology and Committee on Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division, Chicago, IL, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Metro North Hospital and Health Service, Herston, QLD, Australia.; Department of Rheumatology, Level 1, North Wing, Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Austin Health, 300 Waterdale Road, PO Box 5444, Heidelberg West, VIC, 3081, Australia. david.liew@austin.org.au.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Austin Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. david.liew@austin.org.au.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. david.liew@austin.org.au.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37490213,

"Gastrointestinal Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2: Transmission, Pathogenesis, Immunomodulation, Microflora Dysbiosis, and Clinical Implications.",May 2023,"The clinical manifestation of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the respiratory system of humans is widely recognized. There is increasing evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 possesses the capability to invade the gastrointestinal (GI) system, leading to the manifestation of symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and GI lesions. These symptoms subsequently contribute to the development of gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms linking these GI symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unelucidated. During infection, SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and other host proteases in the GI tract during the infection, possibly causing GI symptoms by damaging the intestinal barrier and stimulating inflammatory factor production, respectively. The symptoms of COVID-19-induced GI infection and IBD include intestinal inflammation, mucosal hyperpermeability, bacterial overgrowth, dysbiosis, and changes in blood and fecal metabolomics. Deciphering the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and understanding its exacerbation may provide insights into disease prognosis and pave the way for the discovery of potential novel targets for disease prevention or treatment. Besides the usual transmission routes, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted via the feces of an infected person. Hence, it is crucial to implement preventive and control measures in order to mitigate the fecal-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Within this context, the identification and diagnosis of GI tract symptoms during these infections assume significance as they facilitate early detection of the disease and the development of targeted therapeutics. The present review discusses the receptors, pathogenesis, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a particular focus on the induction of gut immune responses, the influence of gut microbes, and potential therapeutic targets against COVID-19-induced GI infection and IBD.","Durairajan, Siva Sundara Kumar; Singh, Abhay Kumar; Saravanan, Udhaya Bharathy; Namachivayam, Mayurikaa; Radhakrishnan, Moorthi; Huang, Jian-Dong; Dhodapkar, Rahul; Zhang, Hongjie",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v15061231,37376531,"Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur 610005, India.; Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur 610005, India.; Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur 610005, India.; Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur 610005, India.; Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur 610005, India.; Department of Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong 999077, China.; CAS Key Laboratory of Quantitative Engineering Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.; Department of Microbiology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Government of India, Puducherry 605006, India.; School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong 999077, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37376531,

Early in the pandemic, the specific risks for IBD patients were unclear as guidance was based on expert opinion regarding the management of IBD during a COVID-19 era. Fortunately, after considerable work in the field, the overwhelming evidence suggests that IBD patients as a whole do not appear to be at increased risk for more severe disease from COVID-19. Certain risk factors such as age, steroids, comorbidities, combination immunomodulatory therapy, and IBD disease activity have been associated with worse outcomes. Most IBD medications are low risk, with the exception of immunomodulator monotherapy and combination therapy with thiopurine and anti-TNF. Vaccination remains safe and effective for all IBD patients, although additional booster doses may be necessary, particularly in patients taking anti-TNF agents.","Scalzo, Nicholas; Ungaro, Ryan C",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,1756-283X,10.1177/17562848231176450,37337593,"Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L Levy Place, Department of Medicine Box 1118, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA.; The Dr. Henry D.

Differential Gene Expression Profiles Involved in the Inflammations Due to COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and  the Investigation of Predictive Biomarkers.,Feb 2024,"Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 were attributed to 74-86% of the hospitalised patients due to severe or prolonged pathogenesis. Though it is a respiratory disease, the impact it elicits on the gastrointestinal tract and brain are intense. Inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The intrinsic mechanisms involved in gut inflammations due to a respiratory viral disease can be deciphered when the gene expression profiles of COVID-19 and IBD are compared. The current study utilises an integrated bioinformatics approach to unravel them. The publicly available gene expression profiles of colon transcriptomes infected with COVID-19, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis were retrieved, integrated and analysed for the identification of differentially expressed genes. The inter-relational analysis along with gene annotation and pathway enrichment detailed the functional and metabolic pathways of the genes during normal and diseased conditions. The protein-protein interactions deduced from the STRING database and the identified hub genes predicted potential biomarker candidates for COVID-19, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The inflammatory response pathways were upregulated and enrichment of chemokine signalling, altered lipid metabolism, coagulation and complement cascades were seen in all three conditions along with impaired transport mechanisms. CXCL11, MMP10, and CFB are predicted to be overexpressed biomarkers, whilst GUCA2A, SLC13A2, CEACAM, and IGSF9 as downregulated novel biomarker candidates for colon inflammations. The three miRNAs hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-27b-5p exhibited significant interactions with the upregulated hub genes and four long non-coding RNAs NEAT1, KCNQ1OT1, and LINC00852 capable of regulating miRNA were also predicted. This study offers significant information on the underlying molecular mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease with identification of potential biomarkers.","Aishwarya, S; Gunasekaran, K",Biochemical genetics,1573-4927,10.1007/s10528-023-10414-9,37335372,"Department of Bioinformatics, Stella Maris College (Autonomous), Chennai, India. aishwarya@stellamariscollege.edu.in.; CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics, University of Madras, Chennai, India. aishwarya@stellamariscollege.edu.in.; CAS in Crystallography and Biophysics, University of Madras, Chennai, India.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335372,
Telemedicine in inflammatory bowel disease from its origin to the post pandemic golden age: A narrative review.,Jan 2024,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder encompassing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can be disabling and often requires lifelong treatment and follow-up. Digital health technologies and distance-management tools are less costly alternatives for IBD management and clinical monitoring. This review discusses how telephone/videoconference appointments enable treatment optimization from an early disease stage, provide complementary value-based patient care and educational resources, and allow consistent follow-up with a high standard of care. Replacing/supplementing traditional clinical consultations with telemedicine reduces healthcare utilization costs and the need for in-person consultations. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the evolution of telemedicine in IBD, with several studies conducted since 2020 reporting high levels of patient satisfaction. Home-based injectable formulations coupled with telemedicine may become permanently embedded in healthcare systems in the post-pandemic period. While telemedicine consultations are well-accepted by many patients with IBD, they do not suit all patients or are not preferred (e.g., by elderly who do not have the means or ability to understand the associated technology). Ultimately, use of telemedicine should be decided by the patient and careful consideration is required to ensure that the patient is willing and capable of a successful remote visit.","Fantini, Massimo Claudio; Loddo, Erica; Petrillo, Amalia Di; Onali, Sara",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,1878-3562,10.1016/j.dld.2023.05.035,37330279,"Department of Medical Science and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria (AOU) di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.

Third and Fourth Vaccine Doses Broaden and Prolong Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Adult Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,Aug 2023,"Previous studies have reported impaired humoral responses after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), particularly those treated with anti-TNF biologics. We previously reported that IMID patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis exhibited greater waning of Ab and T cell responses than healthy control subjects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose 2. Fewer data are available on the effects of third and fourth doses. This observational cohort study collected plasma and PBMCs from healthy control subjects and untreated or treated patients with IMIDs prevaccination and after one to four doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab levels, neutralization, and T cell cytokine release were measured against wild-type and Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 variants of concern. Third vaccine doses substantially restored and prolonged Ab and T cell responses in patients with IMIDs and broadened responses against variants of concern. Fourth-dose effects were subtle but also prolonged Ab responses. However, patients with IMIDs treated with anti-TNF, especially patients with inflammatory bowel disease, exhibited lower Ab responses even after the fourth dose. Although T cell IFN-γ responses were maximal after one dose, IL-2 and IL-4 production increased with successive doses, and early production of these cytokines was predictive of neutralization responses at 3-4 mo postvaccination. Our study demonstrates that third and fourth doses of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines sustain and broaden immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, supporting the recommendation for three- and four-dose vaccination regimens in patients with IMIDs.","Cheung, Michelle W; Dayam, Roya M; Shapiro, Janna R; Law, Jaclyn C; Chao, Gary Y C; Pereira, Daniel; Goetgebuer, Rogier L; Croitoru, David; Stempak, Joanne M; Acheampong, Lily; Rizwan, Saima; Lee, Jenny D; Jacob, Liz; Ganatra, Darshini; Law, Ryan; Rodriguez-Castellanos, Victoria E; Kern-Smith, Madeline; Delgado-Brand, Melanie; Mailhot, Genevieve; Haroon, Nigil; Inman, Robert D; Piguet, Vincent; Chandran, Vinod; Silverberg, Mark S; Watts, Tania H; Gingras, Anne-Claude","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1550-6606,10.4049/jimmunol.2300190,37326480,"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Schroeder Arthritis Institute, Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Zane Cohen Centre for Digestive Diseases, Division of Gastroenterology, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37326480,
Coronavirus disease 2019 and gastrointestinal disorders in children.,2023,"During the past 3 years, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on people all over the world. However, it has become evident that disease manifestations and severity differ across age groups. Most children have a milder disease course than adults but possibly more pronounced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Given the child's developing immune system, the impact of COVID-19 on disease development may differ compared to adults. This study reviews the potential bi-directional relationship between COVID-19 and GI diseases in children, focusing on common pediatric conditions such as functional GI disorders (FGID), celiac disease (CeD), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Children with GI diseases, in general, and CeD and IBD, in particular, do not seem to have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including risks of hospitalization, critical care need, and death. While infections are considered candidate environmental factors in both CeD and IBD pathogenesis, and specific infectious agents are known triggers for FGID, there is still not sufficient evidence to implicate COVID-19 in the development of either of these diseases. However, given the scarcity of data and the possible latency period between environmental triggers and disease development, future investigations in this field are warranted.","Röckert Tjernberg, Anna; Malmborg, Petter; Mårild, Karl",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,1756-283X,10.1177/17562848231177612,37305380,"Department of Pediatrics, Kalmar County Hospital, Region Kalmar County, Kalmar S-391 85, Sweden.; Sachs' Children and Youth Hospital, Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Science and Education, Södersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37305380,

Investigating the association between the COVID-19 vaccination and incident gastrointestinal symptomology: A comprehensive dataset.,Jun 2023,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a variety of symptoms from mild to acute in the general population. Additional disease burden was experienced in high-risk populations, such as older adults, people with disabilities or overweight, those from racial and ethnic minority groups, and patients with cancer, chronic kidney, lung or liver disease, or diabetes. Although it is well-known that SARS-CoV-2 mostly affects the respiratory tract, studies have revealed the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The best protection against infection is through receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, which is associated with a low incidence of adverse events. However, there is limited research on the lesser-known side effects experienced following receipt of the COVID-19 vaccination, amongst healthy and special needs populations. This study investigated the association between the COVID-19 vaccination and, when it occurred, infection, and resulting gastrointestinal (GI) symptomology, focusing on both the general population and on those previously diagnosed with GI disorders, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Through a short, anonymous survey, 215 participants were assessed for acute onset of GI issues and/or worsening of pre-existing GI issues following the receipt of one or more COVID-19 vaccine doses and following contraction of COVID-19 itself, when applicable. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4, and prior to study initiation, the study protocol was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Stamford Hospital's Institutional Review Board of record. Data analysis included reporting of demographic variables as well as descriptive statistics regarding side effects experienced after receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as after contracting COVID-19, if it occurred.

"Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis: mechanisms, diseases, and inhibitors.",2023,"Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis and downstream inflammation are important self-protection mechanisms against stimuli and infections. Hosts can defend against intracellular bacterial infections by inducing cell pyroptosis, which triggers the clearance of pathogens. However, pyroptosis is a double-edged sword. Numerous studies have revealed the relationship between abnormal GSDMD activation and various inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and malignant tumors. GSDMD, a key pyroptosis-executing protein, is linked to inflammatory signal transduction, activation of various inflammasomes, and the release of downstream inflammatory cytokines. Thus, inhibiting GSDMD activation is considered an effective strategy for treating related inflammatory diseases. The study of the mechanism of GSDMD activation, the formation of GSDMD membrane pores, and the regulatory strategy of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis is currently a hot topic. Moreover, studies of the structure of caspase-GSDMD complexes and more in-depth molecular mechanisms provide multiple strategies for the development of GSDMD inhibitors. This review will mainly discuss the structures of GSDMD and GSDMD pores, activation pathways, GSDMD-mediated diseases, and the development of GSDMD inhibitors.","Dai, Zhen; Liu, Wan-Cong; Chen, Xiao-Yi; Wang, Xiao; Li, Jun-Long; Zhang, Xiang",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1178662,37275856,"Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China.; Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China.; Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.; Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.; Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China.; Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37275856,

Moreover, a novel technique named electrochemical deposition and mild thermal annealing (EDMIT) is applied to overcome signal variations. By taking advantage of the low adhesion of gold clusters on indium tin oxide substrates, both the uniformity and sphericity of gold nanoparticles are increased under mild thermal annealing conditions via coalescence and Ostwald ripening.

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Mar 2023,"Inflammatory bowel diseases represent a complex array of diseases of incompletely known etiology that led to gastrointestinal tract chronic inflammation. In inflammatory bowel disease, a promising method of treatment is represented by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), FMT has shown its increasing effectiveness and safety in recent years for recurrent CDI; moreover, it showed real clinical benefits in treating SARS-CoV-2 and CDI co-infection. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by immune dysregulation, resulting in digestive tract damage caused by immune responses. Most current therapeutic strategies are associated with high costs and many adverse effects by directly targeting the immune response, so modifying the microbial environment by FMT offers an alternative approach that could indirectly influence the host's immune system in a safe way. Studies outline the endoscopic and clinical improvements in UC and CD in FMT patients versus control groups. This review outlines the multiple benefits of FMT in the case of IBD by improving patients unbalanced gut, therefore improving endoscopic and clinical symptomatology. We aim to emphasize the clinical importance and benefits of FMT in order to prevent flares or complications of IBD and to highlight that further validation is needed for establishing a clinical protocol for FMT in IBD.","Boicean, Adrian; Birlutiu, Victoria; Ichim, Cristian; Anderco, Paula; Birsan, Sabrina",Biomedicines,2227-9059,10.3390/biomedicines11041016,37189634,"County Clinical Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.; Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.; County Clinical Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.; Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.; County Clinical Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.; Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.; Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.; County Clinical Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.; Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37189634,

Two Case Reports of Newly Diagnosed Crohn's Disease after COVID-19 in Pediatric Patients.,Apr 2023,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), various complications have been reported. Although most COVID-19 cases exhibited flu-like symptoms, COVID-19 may dysregulate the immune response and promote overwhelming levels of inflammation in some patients. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by dysregulated or inappropriate immune responses to environmental factors in a genetically susceptible host, and a SARS-CoV-2 infection may act as a possible cause of IBD. This paper describes two pediatric patients who developed Crohn's disease following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were previously healthy before the SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, they started to develop fever and gastrointestinal symptoms several weeks after recovery from the infection. They were diagnosed with Crohn's disease by imaging and endoscopic studies, and their symptoms improved after treatment with steroids and azathioprine. This paper suggests that a SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger IBD in predisposed patients.","Kim, Kukwon; Kim, Su-Yeon; Kim, Yong Eun; Kwon, Kye-Won; Han, Eun Mee; Kim, Ahlee",The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi,2233-6869,10.4166/kjg.2022.144,37096436,"Department of Pediatrics, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; Department of Pathology, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; Department of Pathology, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Bundang Jesaeng General Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37096436,
Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Diagnosis and Pharmaceutical Management.,Jan 2023,"Inflammatory bowel disease has an enormous impact on public health, medical systems, economies, and social conditions. Biologic therapy has ameliorated the treatment and clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy and safety profiles of currently available therapies are still less that optimal in numerous ways, highlighting the requirement for new therapeutic targets. A bunch of new drug studies are underway in inflammatory bowel disease with promising results. This is an outlined guideline of clinical diagnosis and pharmaceutical therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. Outline delineates the overall recommendations on the modern principles of desirable practice to bolster the adoption of best implementations and exploration as well as inflammatory bowel disease patient, gastroenterologist, and other healthcare provider education. Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two unsolved medical inflammatory bowel disease-subtypes condition with no drug for cure. The signs and symptoms on first presentation relate to the anatomical localization and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis that can clinically and histologically be non-definitive to interpret and establish criteria, specifically in colonic inflammatory bowel disease when the establishment is inconclusive is classified as indeterminate colitis. Conservative pharmaceuticals and accessible avenues do not depend on the disease phenotype. The first line management is to manage symptoms and stabilize active disease; at the same time maintenance therapy is indicated. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role but is warranted as supportive care. There is need of special guideline that explore solution of groundwork gap in terms of access limitations to inflammatory bowel disease care, particularly in developing countries and the irregular representation of socioeconomic stratification with a strategic plan, for the unanswered questions and perspective for the future, especially during the surfaced global COVID-19 pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2 impacting on both the patient's psychological functioning and endoscopy services. Establishment of a global registry system and accumulated experiences have led to consensus for inflammatory bowel disease management under the COVID-19 pandemic. Painstakingly, the pandemic has influenced medical care systems for these patients. I briefly herein viewpoint summarize among other updates the telemedicine roles during the pandemic and how operationally inflammatory bowel disease centers managed patients and ensured quality of care. In conclusion: inflammatory bowel disease has become a global emergent disease. Serious medical errors are public health problem observed in developing nations i.e., to distinguish inflammatory bowel disease and infectious and parasitic diseases. Refractory inflammatory bowel disease is a still significant challenge in the management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. There are gaps in knowledge and future research directions on the recent newly registered pharmaceuticals.

A New Onset of Ulcerative Colitis Post-COVID-19: A Case Report.,Mar 2023,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause not only respiratory symptoms but also gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, there is increased concern about the autoimmune complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This report describes a 21-year-old non-smoking Caucasian male with a history of acute pancreatitis but no other medical issues or family history who developed a new onset of ulcerative colitis after the second episode of COVID-19. He had three doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two months after the first episode of COVID-19, he had the third dose of the vaccine. Nine months after the third dose, he had the second episode of COVID-19, during which he was mildly unwell for three days, recovered, and did not require any anti-viral medication or antibiotics. One week post the second episode of COVID-19, he developed diarrhoea and abdominal pain. It then progressed to bloody diarrhea. We diagnosed ulcerative colitis based on his clinical symptoms, biopsy changes, and the exclusion of other causes. This case raises awareness of developing ulcerative colitis concurrently with or following COVID-19. It is essential to thoroughly investigate COVID-19 patients who have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and not consider it a common gastroenteritis or a simple gastrointestinal manifestation of COVID-19. Although we cannot confirm the association with a case study, further research is needed to confirm the causal or incidental relationship and observe any increased incidence of ulcerative colitis in the future as secondary to COVID-19.","Xia, Chenfan; Dissanayake, Jayanthi; Badov, David",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.36257,37069864,"Department of Medicine, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, AUS.; Pathology, Dorevitch Pathology, Melbourne, AUS.; Department of Gastroenterology, Frankston Hospital, Melbourne, AUS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37069864,

Functional Analysis of Monkeypox and Interrelationship between Monkeypox and COVID-19 by Bioinformatic Analysis.,2023,"The outbreak of monkeypox may be considered a novel and urgent threat after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). No wide-ranging studies have been conducted on this disease since it was first reported. We systematically assessed the functional role of gene expression in cells infected with the monkeypox virus using transcriptome profiling and compared the functional relation with that of COVID-19. Based on the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we obtained 212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of GSE36854 and GSE21001 of monkeypox datasets. Enrichment analyses, including KEGG and gene ontology (GO) analyses, were performed to identify the common function of 212 DEGs of GSE36854 and GSE21001. CytoHubba and Molecular Complex Detection were performed to determine the core genes after a protein-protein interaction (PPI). Metascape/COVID-19 was used to compare DEGs of monkeypox and COVID-19. GO analysis of 212 DEGs of GSE36854 and GSE21001 for monkeypox infection showed cellular response to cytokine stimulus, cell activation, and cell differentiation regulation. KEGG analysis of 212 DEGs of GSE36854 and GSE21001 for monkeypox infection showed involvement of monkeypox in COVID-19, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, TNF signaling, and T cell receptor signaling. By comparing our data with published transcriptome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in other cell lines, the common function of monkeypox and COVID-19 includes cytokine signaling in the immune system, TNF signaling, and MAPK cascade regulation.

The colonic interleukin-19 aggravates the dextran sodium sulfate/stress-induced comorbidities due to colitis and anxiety.,2023,"Comorbidities due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and anxiety are commonly acknowledged; however, their underlying basis is unclear. In the current study, we first conducted a clinical retrospective analysis to identify the enhancive incidence rate of IBD before or after the epidemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with higher Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), as well as poorer Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Then, the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced IBD and anxiety comorbid models were established with the correlational relations between symptoms of IBD and anxiety-related behaviors. We found dysfunctional up-regulation of a new inflammatory factor interleukin (IL)-19 in the colon of DSS/CUS treated mice. Overexpression of IL-19 in colon induced anxious phenotypes, and accelerated the anxious condition and symptoms of colitis in the DSS/CUS model by promoting the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1β, and IL-6 pro-inflammatory factors, and activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in the colon. Furthermore, overexpression of IL-19 in the colon also reduced the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways activity in the hippocampus. These results suggest that IL-19 was a pivotal player in DSS/CUS-induced comorbidities of colitis and anxiety with different signaling pathways for the colon and hippocampus, which provides a candidate gene to explore the pathophysiology of comorbidities due to colitis and anxiety.","Li, Qiongyu; Meng, Fantao; Ma, Xiangxian; Sun, Zhe; Dai, Juanjuan; Liu, Jing; Li, Dan; Cong, Peijia; Xu, Ruixue; Zhao, Di; Wang, Wentao; Wang, Dan; Liu, Cuilan; Wang, Faxiang; Li, Chen; Lian, Haifeng",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1153344,36936941,"Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Psychology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; College of Nursing, Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Neurology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Medical Research Center, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.; Institute for Metabolic & Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36936941,
Serum titer of neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Mar 2023,"Vaccination is an important strategy to reduce the infection rate and adverse events of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effect of COVID-19 vaccination for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the serum titer of neutralizing antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with IBD, treated with and without immunosuppressive therapy. The study consisted of 108 patients with IBD [76 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 32 with Crohn's disease (CD)] from the gastroenterology outpatient clinic at the Hospital of the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine who underwent anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. The control group included 64 healthy subjects who received the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. When 10 AU/ml of neutralizing antibodies was used as cut-off value, the positive rates of neutralizing antibodies of patients with UC, patients with DC, and the control group were 97.3%, 84.3%, and 100%, respectively. The neutralizing antibody titer showed no difference between patients treated with and without immunosuppressive therapy.

Case report of new-onset ulcerative colitis after MVC-COVI1901 vaccine injection for SARS-CoV-2.,Aug 2023,"A 23-year-old man suffered from diarrhea after receiving the MVC-COVI1901 vaccine. The patient then presented to our emergency department due to swelling and pain in his right knee. Synovial effusion studies of the right knee revealed inflammation. Gram and acid-fast stains reported negative results and no crystals were found under a polarized light microscope. During his hospitalization, the patient underwent a colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT) due to bloody stool. Pancolitis was suspected under colonoscopy and an abdominal CT scan supported our diagnosis showing wall thickening and mucosal enhancement. Pathology showed distorted crypt architecture and acute cryptitis with abscesses. After excluding other causes of ulcerative colitis (UC), the patient was diagnosed with MVC-COV1901 vaccine-related UC and inflammatory bowel disease arthropathy. Subsequent presentation of UC and inflammatory bowel disease-related arthropathy after receiving the MVC-COVI1901 vaccine has not previously been reported. We speculate that the pathogenesis could be correlated to the vaccine's components (spike protein S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide) through the combination of 2 effects: the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 by S-2P, and the activation of TLR9 and expression of interleukin-13 by CpG-1018 adjuvant.

Intestinal organoids: A versatile platform for modeling gastrointestinal diseases and monitoring epigenetic alterations.,Apr 2023,"Considering the significant limitations of conventional 2D cell cultures and tissue in vitro models, creating intestinal organoids has burgeoned as an ideal option to recapitulate the heterogeneity of the native intestinal epithelium. Intestinal organoids can be developed from either tissue-resident adult stem cells (ADSs) or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in both forms induced PSCs and embryonic stem cells. Here, we review current advances in the development of intestinal organoids that have led to a better recapitulation of the complexity, physiology, morphology, function, and microenvironment of the intestine. We discuss current applications of intestinal organoids with an emphasis on disease modeling. In particular, we point out recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human intestinal organoids. We also discuss the less explored application of intestinal organoids in epigenetics by highlighting the role of epigenetic modifications in intestinal development, homeostasis, and diseases, and subsequently the power of organoids in mirroring the regulatory role of epigenetic mechanisms in these conditions and introducing novel predictive/diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, we propose 3D organoid models to evaluate the effects of novel epigenetic drugs (epi-drugs) on the treatment of GI diseases where epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in disease development and progression, particularly in colorectal cancer treatment and epigenetically acquired drug resistance.","Ghorbaninejad, Mahsa; Asadzadeh-Aghdaei, Hamid; Baharvand, Hossein; Meyfour, Anna",Life sciences,1879-0631,10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121506,36858311,"Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Developmental Biology, School of Basic Sciences and Advanced Technologies in Biology, University of Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran; Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.

"Vitamin D: immune function, inflammation, infections and auto-immunity.",Nov 2023,"Vitamin D plays an active role beyond mineral metabolism and skeletal health, including regulation of the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent, and observational studies link low vitamin D status to a risk of infections and auto-immune disorders. Reports indicate an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and such conditions. This review details vitamin D signalling interactions with the immune system and provides experimental and clinical evidence evaluating vitamin D status, vitamin D supplementation and host susceptibility to infections, inflammation and auto-immunity. The published literature including related reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies and basic science reports have been synthesised. Meta-analyses of observational studies have demonstrated a link between low vitamin D status and risk of acute respiratory infections, COVID-19 disorders, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus and other auto-immune disorders. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may protect against several infectious and auto-immune conditions. Meta-analyses of RCTs had mixed results, demonstrating a small protective role for vitamin D supplementation against acute respiratory infections, especially in those with vitamin D deficiency and children, and providing modest benefits for the management of T1DM and IBD. Vitamin D status is inversely associated with the incidence of several infectious and auto-immune conditions. Supplementation is recommended for those with vitamin D deficiency or at high risk of deficiency, and it might provide additional benefit in acute respiratory infections and certain auto-immune conditions.","Johnson, Casey R; Thacher, Tom D",Paediatrics and international child health,2046-9055,10.1080/20469047.2023.2171759,36857810,"Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, New York, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36857810,

Computational Simulation Model to Predict Behavior Changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of Two Regional Japanese Populations.,Jan 2023,"Managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major challenge for physicians and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the impact of the pandemic on patient behaviors and disruptions in medical care, we used a combination of population-based modeling, system dynamics simulation, and linear optimization. Synthetic IBD populations in Tokyo and Hokkaido were created by localizing an existing US-based synthetic IBD population using data from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan. A clinical pathway of IBD-specific disease progression was constructed and calibrated using longitudinal claims data from JMDC Inc for patients with IBD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points considered for disruptions in patient behavior (demand) and medical care (supply) were diagnosis of new patients, clinic visits for new patients seeking care and diagnosed patients receiving continuous care, number of procedures, and the interval between procedures or biologic prescriptions. COVID-19 had a large initial impact and subsequent smaller impacts on demand and supply despite higher infection rates. Our population model (Behavior Predictor) and patient treatment simulation model (Demand Simulator) represent the dynamics of clinical care demand among patients with IBD in Japan, both in recapitulating historical demand curves and simulating future demand during disruption scenarios, such as pandemic, earthquake, and economic crisis.","Suzuki, Gen; Iwakiri, Ryuichi; Udagawa, Eri; Ma, Sindy; Takayama, Ryoko; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Nakamura, Koshi; Burns, Samuel P; D'Alessandro, Paul Michael; Fernandez, Jovelle",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm12030757,36769406,"Japan Medical Office, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Tokyo 103-8668, Japan.; Japan Medical Office, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Tokyo 103-8668, Japan.; Japan Medical Office, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Tokyo 103-8668, Japan.; PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services LLC, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA.; PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting LLC, Tokyo 100-0004, Japan.; Health & Environment Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8601, Japan.; Department of Public Health and Hygiene, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.; PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services LLC, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA.; PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services LLC, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA.; Japan Medical Office, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Tokyo 103-8668, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36769406,

A Comparison of the Effects of COVID-19 on Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients While Working at Home and in the Office: A Retrospective Study.,Jan 2023,"Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a strong relationship with psychological stress. Studies have shown increased stress levels in patients with IBS and IBD during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current literature on the impact of work environment on IBD and IBS symptoms is limited, particularly during the current pandemic. Objective This study aims to analyze how the pandemic impacted patients with IBS and IBD in the setting of staying home versus working outside the home. Methods After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, a retrospective review of 245 patients with IBS and IBD who followed with our gastroenterology clinic in the past year was performed. Patients were asked about symptoms including, but not limited to, worsening diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Pearson's chi-squared test was used for analysis. Results Of the 245 patients in our study, 67 had IBS, 166 had IBD, and 12 had both. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.4. A total of 136 (55.5%) patients worked from home during the pandemic, while 109 (44.5%) patients worked outside. Eighty-three patients working from home reported no change in symptoms, 35 reported worsening symptoms, and 18 reported an improvement in symptoms. Sixty-eight patients working outside the home reported no change in symptoms, 26 reported worsening symptoms, and 15 reported improvements. Working outside the home had a statistically significant relationship with COVID-19 infection. Thirty patients were infected, of which 22 (73.3%) worked outside the home (p=0.01). Overall, 203 (82.8%) patients received the vaccine, and only 14 of these patients reported worsening gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms one week after receiving the vaccine. Comparable results were seen after dividing the data into cohorts of IBS and IBD patients. Of the patients with IBD staying at home, 15.9% had depression (p=0.01). Conclusion Most patients had symptoms at baseline. There was no statistically significant correlation between change in symptoms and work settings. Patients were less likely to be infected with COVID-19 while staying home. Our patient population showed a high vaccination rate of 82.9% as compared to the national average of 59.2% (source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). Only 5.7% of the patients reported new or worsening gastrointestinal symptoms in the week following vaccination. The limitations of the study included its retrospective design and poor correlation in general between symptoms and disease activity in IBD patients.","Zouridis, Spyridon; Ashraf, Muhammad Farhan; Tempera, Patrick; Abulawi, Ahmad; Malik, Umer Ejaz; Minhas, Hadi; Batool, Asra",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.33266,36741653,"Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.; Gastroenterology, Rochester Regional Health, Rochester, USA.; Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.; Internal Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.; Gastroenterology, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.; Gastroenterology, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.; Gastroenterology, Albany Medical Center, Albany, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36741653,

Customer-centric product presentations for monoclonal antibodies.,2023,"Delivering customer-centric product presentations for biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), represents a long-standing and paramount area of engagement for pharmaceutical scientists. Activities include improving experience with the dosing procedure, reducing drug administration-related expenditures, and ultimately shifting parenteral treatments outside of a controlled healthcare institutional setting. In times of increasingly cost-constrained markets and reinforced with the coronavirus pandemic, this discipline of ""Product Optimization"" in healthcare has gained momentum and changed from a nice-to-have into a must. This review summarizes latest trends in the healthcare ecosystem that inform key strategies for developing customer-centric products, including the availability of a wider array of sustainable drug delivery options and treatment management plans that support dosing in a flexible care setting. Three disease area archetypes with varying degree of implementation of customer-centric concepts are introduced to highlight relevant market differences and similarities.

COVID-19 induced mesenteric ischemia in a patient with ulcerative colitis and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria despite thromboprophylaxis.,Mar 2023,"Inflammatory bowel disease and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are both well-known prothrombotic states. However, ongoing thromboprophylaxis is usually effective in such conditions. We report an imbalance that was triggered by COVID-19 infection. There is evidence that COVID-19 infection leads to thrombosis of vessels. The thrombosis of mesenteric vessels can be multifocal and without respiratory symptoms and leads to devastating consequences like resection of large segments of the bowel and lifelong requirement of parenteral nutritional support.

Thiopurine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease in the pandemic era: Safe or unsafe?,Mar 2023,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major types affecting millions across the globe. Various immunomodulatory drugs consisting of small molecules (thiopurines, methotrexate and tofacitinib) and biologics are used to treat IBD. Thiopurines (TP) are widely used in the treatment of IBD and it plays an important role both alone and in combination with anti-TNF agents as IBD maintenance therapy. Although the advent of biologics therapy has significantly advanced the management of IBD, TP remains the mainstay of treatment in resource-limited and low economic settings. However, the recently commenced pandemic has raised uncertainty over the safety of the use of immunosuppressant drugs such as TP among healthcare care providers and patients, as there is a scarcity of data on whether IBD patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection or more prone to its severe outcomes.","Perdalkar, Shailesh; Basthi Mohan, Pooja; Musunuri, Balaji; Rajpurohit, Siddheesh; Shetty, Shiran; Bhat, Krishnamurthy; Pai, Cannanore Ganesh",International immunopharmacology,1878-1705,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109597,36702073,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance, Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal 576104, India.

Gut-on-a-chip for disease models.,2023,"The intestinal tract is a vital organ responsible for digestion and absorption in the human body and plays an essential role in pathogen invasion. Compared with other traditional models, gut-on-a-chip has many unique advantages, and thereby, it can be considered as a novel model for studying intestinal functions and diseases. Based on the chip design, we can replicate the in vivo microenvironment of the intestine and study the effects of individual variables on the experiment. In recent years, it has been used to study several diseases. To better mimic the intestinal microenvironment, the structure and function of gut-on-a-chip are constantly optimised and improved. Owing to the complexity of the disease mechanism, gut-on-a-chip can be used in conjunction with other organ chips. In this review, we summarise the human intestinal structure and function as well as the development and improvement of gut-on-a-chip. Finally, we present and discuss gut-on-a-chip applications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), viral infections and phenylketonuria. Further improvement of the simulation and high throughput of gut-on-a-chip and realisation of personalised treatments are the problems that should be solved for gut-on-a-chip as a disease model.","Xian, Changxiu; Zhang, Jiaxin; Zhao, Suqing; Li, Xiang-Guang",Journal of tissue engineering,2041-7314,10.1177/20417314221149882,36699635,"Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36699635,

Exploring the Impact of Covid-19-Related Perceptions on Psychological Distress and Quality of Life in an International Gastrointestinal Cohort Over Time Guided by the Common Sense Model.,Dec 2023,"The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine changes in COVID-19 and illness-related perceptions, gastrointestinal symptoms, coping, catastrophising, psychological distress, and QoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 831 adults with a gastrointestinal condition completed an online questionnaire at baseline (May-October 2020). Of those, 270 (32.5%) participants (85.2% female, mean age = 47.3 years) provided follow-up data (March-May 2021). Repeated-measures multiple analysis of variance and a cross-lagged panel model were used to test the study hypotheses. Gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19 perceptions at follow-up were strongly predicted by their baseline values, while illness perceptions were predicted by baseline gastrointestinal symptoms. Cross-lagged relationships indicated a reciprocal relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and psychological distress. Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms had substantial predictive utility, strongly predicting future gastrointestinal symptoms, and to a lesser extent, more negative illness perceptions, greater psychological distress, and greater use of adaptive coping strategies across time.","Knowles, Simon R; Möller, Stephan P; Stengel, Andreas; Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Ferreira, Nuno; Trindade, Inês A; Mokrowiecka, Anna; Burisch, Johan; Barreiro-de Acosta, Manuel; Bernstein, Charles N; Lo, Bobby; Skvarc, David",Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,1573-3572,10.1007/s10880-023-09937-5,36692701,"Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. sknowles@swin.edu.au.; Department of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Charité Center for Internal Medicine and Dermatology, Department for Psychosomatic Medicine, Charité-Universit¨Atsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität Zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.; School of Psychology, Deakin University Geelong, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.; School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus.; Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Center for Research in Neuropsychology and Cognitive and Behavioural Intervention (CINEICC), Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.; Gastrounit, Medical Division, Copenhagen University Hospital - Amager and Hvidovre, University of Copenhagen, Hvidovre, Denmark.; Copenhagen Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children, Adolescents and Adults, Copenhagen University Hospital - Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark.; IBD Unit.

Expert consensus on vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Japan.,Feb 2023,"Immunosuppressive therapies can affect the immune response to or safety of vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The appropriateness of vaccination should be assessed prior to the initiation of IBD treatment because patients with IBD frequently undergo continuous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.

This consensus includes 19 important clinical questions (CQs) on the following 4 topics: VPDs (6 CQs), live attenuated vaccines (2 CQs), inactivated vaccines (6 CQs), and vaccination for pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding (5 CQs). These topics and CQs were selected under unified consensus by the members of a committee on intractable diseases with support by a Health and Labour Sciences Research Grant. Physicians should provide necessary information on VPDs to their patients with IBD and carefully manage these patients' IBD if various risk factors for the development or worsening of VPDs are present. This consensus will facilitate informed and shared decision-making in daily IBD clinical practice.","Ishige, Takashi; Shimizu, Toshiaki; Watanabe, Kenji; Arai, Katsuhiro; Kamei, Koichi; Kudo, Takahiro; Kunisaki, Reiko; Tokuhara, Daisuke; Naganuma, Makoto; Mizuochi, Tatsuki; Murashima, Atsuko; Inoki, Yuta; Iwata, Naomi; Iwama, Itaru; Koinuma, Sachi; Shimizu, Hirotaka; Jimbo, Keisuke; Takaki, Yugo; Takahashi, Shohei; Cho, Yuki; Nambu, Ryusuke; Nishida, Daisuke; Hagiwara, Shin-Ichiro; Hikita, Norikatsu; Fujikawa, Hiroki; Hosoi, Kenji; Hosomi, Shuhei; Mikami, Yohei; Miyoshi, Jun; Yagi, Ryusuke; Yokoyama, Yoko; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu",Journal of gastroenterology,1435-5922,10.1007/s00535-022-01953-w,36629948,"Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22, Showa-Machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan. ishiget@gunma-u.ac.jp.; Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo Medical University, Nishinomiya, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Center for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Division of Nephrology and Rheumatology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.; Center for Maternal-Fetal, Neonatal and Reproductive Medicine, National Center of Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Division of Nephrology and Rheumatology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Infection and Immunology, Aichi Children's Health and Medical Center, Obu, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.; Japan Drug Information Institute in Pregnancy, National Center of Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Center for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Japanese Red Cross Kumamoto Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.; Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nutrition and Endocrinology, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Center for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology, Tokyo Metro Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22, Showa-Machi, Maebashi, Gunma, 371-8511, Japan.; Department of Intestinal Inflammation Research, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36629948,

Disease activity in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases after SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations.,Feb 2023,"For patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), concerns exist about increased disease activity after vaccination. We aimed to assess changes in disease activity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IMIDs, and determine risk factors for increased disease activity. In this substudy of a prospective observational cohort study (Target-to-B!), we included patients with IMIDs who received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Patients reported changes in disease activity on a five-point Likert scale every 60 days for up to twelve months after first vaccination. In case of self-reported increased activity, hospital records were screened whether the treating physician reported increased activity, and for potential intensification of immunosuppressive (ISP) treatment. Mixed models were used to study determinants for self-reported increased disease activity. In total, 2111 patients were included for analysis after primary immunization (mean age 49.7 years [SD 13.7], 1329/2111 (63.0%) female), from which 1266 patients for analysis after first additional vaccination. Increased disease activity at 60 days after start of primary immunization was reported by 223/2111 (10.6%). In 96/223 (43.0%) the increase was confirmed by the treating physician and in 36/223 (16.1%) ISP treatment was intensified. Increased disease activity at seven to 60 days after additional vaccination, was reported by 139/1266 (11.0%). Vaccinations were not temporally associated with self-reported increased disease activity. Conversely, increased disease activity before first vaccination, neuromuscular disease, and multiple sclerosis were associated. Altogether, self-reported increased disease activity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was recorded in a minority of patients and was generally mild. Moreover, multivariate analyses suggest that disease related factors, but not vaccinations are the major determinants for self-reported increased disease activity.","van Dam, Koos P J; Wieske, Luuk; Stalman, Eileen W;

Management of Ulcerative Colitis Flare-Ups in the Era of COVID-19.,Dec 2022,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whose management depends on its severity, localization, and course. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made the management of this disease more difficult, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) routinely causes respiratory infection, but can also target the gastrointestinal tract. Multiple cases of de novo IBD, IBD flare-ups, and colitis have been associated with COVID-19 infection. We present the case of two patients, with a history of UC, who presented respectively a mild and a severe flare-up of their disease associated with COVID-19 infection. Regardless of recommendations, we decided to optimize the patient's treatment and obtained good clinical, biological, and endoscopic results.

Serological response to vaccination against coronavirus disease-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Feb 2023,"Vaccination against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is effective in preventing the occurrence or reduction in the severity of the infection. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are on immunomodulators, which may alter serological response to vaccination against COVID-19. Accordingly, we studied (i) the serological response to vaccination against COVID-19 in IBD patients and (ii) a comparison of serological response in IBD patients with that in healthy controls. A prospective study was undertaken during a 6-month period (July 2021 to January 2022). Seroconversion was assessed among vaccinated, unvaccinated IBD patients and vaccinated healthy controls using anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. OD is directly proportional to the antibody concentration. One hundred and thirty-two blood samples were collected from 97 IBD patients (85 [87.6%] ulcerative colitis and 12 [12.4%] Crohn's disease). Forty-one of the seventy-one (57.7%) unvaccinated and 60/61 (98.4%) vaccinated IBD patients tested positive (OD > 0.3) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Fourteen of the sixteen (87.5%) healthy controls tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Vaccinated IBD patients had higher ODs than unvaccinated IBD patients (1.31 [1.09-1.70] vs. 0.53 [0.19-1.32], p < 0.001) and 16 vaccinated healthy controls (1.31 [1.09-1.70] vs. 0.64 [0.43-0.78], p < 0.001). Three of the seventy-one (4.2%) unvaccinated IBD patients reported having recovered from COVID-19. Most IBD patients seroconvert after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, similar to a healthy population. A large proportion of IBD patients had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies even before vaccination, suggesting the occurrence of herd immunity.","Mathur, Akash; Sahu, Shikha; Rai, Sushmita; Ghoshal, Ujjala; Ghoshal, Uday C",Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,0975-0711,10.1007/s12664-022-01323-7,36598745,"Departments of Gastroenterology and Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, 226 014, India.; Departments of Gastroenterology and Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, 226 014, India.; Departments of Gastroenterology and Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, 226 014, India.; Departments of Gastroenterology and Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, 226 014, India.; Departments of Gastroenterology and Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, 226 014, India. udayghoshal@gmail.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598745,

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with intestinal lymphangiectasia-associated protein-losing enteropathy accompanying hyperinflammation.,Mar 2023,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has the potential to affect virtually every organ; however, gastrointestinal system manifestations are relatively rare compared to other autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. A 29-year-old female patient attended to the emergency room with abdominal distention, acute onset abdominal pain and constipation. She had watery chronic diarrhea (4-5 times/d) and weight loss (6 kg, 12%) for 4 months. While there was increased intestinal wall thickness, air-liquid levels were shown on abdomen computed tomography scan. The patient underwent abdominal surgery due to diagnosis of ileus. Ileocecal resection was performed and pathologic evaluation revealed intestinal lymphangiectasia. Autoimmune serology was performed with the following resulats: anti-nuclear antibody 1/3200 with homogenous pattern, anti-DNA antibody and anti-Sm/ribonucleoprotein antibodies were positive in addition to low complement levels (C3: 0.28 [0.9-1.8 g/L], C4: 0.06 [0.1-0.4 g/L]) indicating diagnosis of SLE. Development of intestinal involvement in SLE (lupus enteritis) is mainly grouped into 3 headings such as mesenteric vasculitis, pseudo-obstruction, and protein-losing enteropathy. Although the pathogenesis of intestinal lymphangiectasia remains unknown, it has been reported that immune complex-mediated visceral vasculitis may result in bowel wall and mucosal edema. To our knowledge this is the first case report accompanying hyperinflammatory response in addition to intestinal lymphangiectasia in SLE. On the other hand, clinicians should be alert for other reasons for hyperinflammatory syndromes rather than COVID-19, even during the pandemic.","Bektaş, Murat; Taş, Oğuzhan; Ordu, Melike",International journal of rheumatic diseases,1756-185X,10.1111/1756-185X.14541,36562680,"Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aksaray Training and Research Hospital, Aksaray, Turkey.; Department of General Surgery, Aksaray Training and Research Hospital, Aksaray, Turkey.; Department of Pathology, Aksaray Training and Research Hospital, Aksaray, Turkey.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36562680,
COVID-19 Vaccines for Adults and Children with Autoimmune Gut or Liver Disease.,Dec 2022,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic raised many challenges for all patients with chronic conditions and those with autoimmune diseases, both adults and children. Special attention is paid to their immunological status, concomitant diseases, and the need for immunosuppressive therapy. All of these factors may impact their COVID-19 course and outcome. COVID-19 vaccination is accepted as one of the most successful strategies for pandemic control. However, individuals with immune-mediated chronic diseases, including autoimmune liver and gut diseases, have been excluded from the vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on real-world data from vaccination after vaccine approval for these patients to fill the evidence gap for the long-term safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with autoimmune gut and liver diseases. Current recommendations from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) societies suggest COVID-19 vaccination in children older than 5 years old, adults and even pregnant females with IBD. The same recommendations are applied to patients with autoimmune liver diseases. Nevertheless, autoimmune disease patients still experience high levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and more studies have to be conducted to clarify this issue.","Peshevska-Sekulovska, Monika; Bakalova, Plamena; Snegarova, Violeta; Lazova, Snezhina; Velikova, Tsvetelina",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines10122075,36560485,"Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Lozenetz, 1407 Sofia, Bulgaria.; Medical Faculty, Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, 1407 Sofia, Bulgaria.; Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Lozenetz, 1407 Sofia, Bulgaria.; Clinic of Internal Diseases, Naval Hospital-Varna, Military Medical Academy, Medical Faculty, Medical University, 9000 Varna, Bulgaria.; Pediatric Department, University Hospital ""N.

"Risk Factors for COVID-19 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A National, ENEIDA-Based Case-Control Study (COVID-19-EII).",Dec 2022,"(1) Scant information is available concerning the characteristics that may favour the acquisition of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess these differences between infected and noninfected patients with IBD. (2) This nationwide case−control study evaluated patients with inflammatory bowel disease with COVID-19 (cases) and without COVID-19 (controls) during the period March−July 2020 included in the ENEIDA of GETECCU. (3) A total of 496 cases and 964 controls from 73 Spanish centres were included. No differences were found in the basal characteristics between cases and controls. Cases had higher comorbidity Charlson scores (24% vs. 19%; p = 0.02) and occupational risk (28% vs. 10.5%; p < 0.0001) more frequently than did controls. Lockdown was the only protective measure against COVID-19 (50% vs. 70%; p < 0.0001). No differences were found in the use of systemic steroids, immunosuppressants or biologics between cases and controls. Cases were more often treated with 5-aminosalicylates (42% vs. 34%; p = 0.003). Having a moderate Charlson score (OR: 2.7; 95%CI: 1.3−5.9), occupational risk (OR: 2.9; 95%CI: 1.8−4.4) and the use of 5-aminosalicylates (OR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.2−2.5) were factors for COVID-19. The strict lockdown was the only protective factor (OR: 0.1; 95%CI: 0.09−0.2). (4) Comorbidities and occupational exposure are the most relevant factors for COVID-19 in patients with IBD. The risk of COVID-19 seems not to be increased by immunosuppressants or biologics, with a potential effect of 5-aminosalicylates, which should be investigated further and interpreted with caution.","Zabana, Yamile;

Dysregulated haemostasis in thrombo-inflammatory disease.,Dec 2022,"Inflammatory disease is often associated with an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in affected patients, although in most instances, the mechanistic basis for this increased thrombogenicity remains poorly understood. Acute infection, as exemplified by sepsis, malaria and most recently, COVID-19, drives 'immunothrombosis', where the immune defence response to capture and neutralise invading pathogens causes concurrent activation of deleterious prothrombotic cellular and biological responses. Moreover, dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, and neurodegenerative disorders, are now recognised to occur in parallel with activation of coagulation. In this review, we describe the detailed cellular and biochemical mechanisms that cause inflammation-driven haemostatic dysregulation, including aberrant contact pathway activation, increased tissue factor activity and release, innate immune cell activation and programmed cell death, and T cell-mediated changes in thrombus resolution. In addition, we consider how lifestyle changes increasingly associated with modern life, such as circadian rhythm disruption, chronic stress and old age, are increasingly implicated in unbalancing haemostasis. Finally, we describe the emergence of potential therapies with broad-ranging immunothrombotic functions, and how drug development in this area is challenged by our nascent understanding of the key molecular and cellular parameters that control the shared nodes of proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways. Despite the increasing recognition and understanding of the prothrombotic nature of inflammatory disease, significant challenges remain in effectively managing affected patients, and new therapeutic approaches to curtail the key pathogenic steps in immune response-driven thrombosis are urgently required.","Klavina, Paula A; Leon, Gemma; Curtis, Annie M; Preston, Roger J S","Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",1470-8736,10.1042/CS20220208,36524413,"Irish Centre of Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.; Irish Centre of Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.; National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.; Irish Centre of Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.; Irish Centre of Vascular Biology, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.; National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36524413,

COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,Mar 2023,"The susceptibility, risk factors, and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unknown. Thus, our study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in IBD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and medRxiv from 2019 to 1 June 2022 for cohort and case-control studies comparing the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD and in the general population. We also compared the outcomes of patients receiving and not receiving 5-aminosalicylates (ASA), tumour necrosis factor antagonists, biologics, systemic corticosteroids, or immunomodulators for IBD. Thirty five studies were eligible for our analysis. Pooled odds ratio of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death in IBD compared to in non-IBD were 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-1.18), 1.09 (95% CI = 0.27-4.47), and 0.67 (95% CI = 0.32-1.42), respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease was not associated with increased hospitalisation, ICU admission, or death. Susceptibility to COVID-19 did not increase with any drugs for IBD. Hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death were more likely with 5-ASA and corticosteroid use. COVID-19-related hospitalisation (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI = 0.38-0.74) and death (OR: 0.13; 95% CI = 0.13-0.70) were less likely with Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis (UC). In conclusion, IBD does not increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19. However, physicians should be aware that additional monitoring is needed in UC patients or in patients taking 5-ASA or systemic corticosteroids.","Lee, Min Ho; Li, Han Jacob; Wasuwanich, Paul; Kim, Sung Eun; Kim, Jong Yeob; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Park, Seoyeon; Yang, Jae Won; Kim, Min Seo; Yon, Dong Keon; Lee, Seung Won; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Kim, Eun-Young; Cheon, Jae Hee; Shin, Jae Il; Smith, Lee",Reviews in medical virology,1099-1654,10.1002/rmv.2414,36504172,"Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; University of Florida College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; University of Florida College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Gyeongsang National University College of Medicine, Jinju, Republic of Korea.; Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Nephrology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.; Department of Digital Health, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences & Technology (SAIHST), Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Medical Science Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Precision Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea.; Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERSAM, ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.; ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.; Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, CIBERSAM, ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Health, Social and Clinical Pharmacy, Evidence-Based and Clinical Research Laboratory, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36504172,
Tryptophan Metabolism 'Hub' Gene Expression Associates with Increased Inflammation and Severe Disease Outcomes in COVID-19 Infection and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Nov 2022,"The epithelial barrier's primary role is to protect against entry of foreign and pathogenic elements. Both COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) show commonalities in symptoms and treatment with sensitization of the epithelial barrier inviting an immune response. In this study we use a multi-omics strategy to identify a common signature of immune disease that may be able to predict for more severe patient outcomes. Global proteomic approaches were applied to transcriptome and proteome. Further semi- and relative- quantitative targeted mass spectrometry methods were developed to substantiate the proteomic and metabolomics changes in nasal swabs from healthy, COVID-19 (24 h and 3 weeks post infection); serums from Crohn's disease patients (scored for epithelial leak), terminal ileum tissue biopsies (patient matched inflamed and non-inflamed regions, and controls). We found that the tryptophan/kynurenine metabolism pathway is a 'hub' regulator of canonical and non-canonical transcription, macrophage release of cytokines and significant changes in the immune and metabolic status with increasing severity and disease course.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Outcomes in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.,Dec 2022,"The impact of COVID-19 on pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is still not clear and the knowledge acquired over the last 2 years is still evolving. This study aims to investigate the risk and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with PIBD. A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to identify studies published up until September 2022. Out of the 475 articles screened, 14 studies were included in the review. Of the 4006 children with PIBD included, 390 (9.7%) tested positive for COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 5.9% (0-16.7%) needed hospitalization, 0.6% (0-1%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and no deaths were reported. Among the included studies, only four presented details regarding patients' symptoms, with 21% (0-25%) presenting gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. An association between PIBD activity or specific treatment and COVID-19 outcome could not be established. The prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with PIBD was low; therefore, the initial concerns regarding higher infection risk and worse prognosis in this population are not supported by the currently available data. Further research is needed to determine the natural history of the infection and the optimal treatment for these patients. Much is still unclear and additional studies should be performed in order to optimize prevention and care for this special group of patients.","Batsiou, Anastasia; Mantzios, Petros; Piovani, Daniele; Tsantes, Andreas G; Kopanou Taliaka, Paschalia; Liakou, Paraskevi; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Tsantes, Argirios E; Bonovas, Stefanos; Sokou, Rozeta",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm11237238,36498812,"Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, ""Agios Panteleimon"" General Hospital of Nikea, 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Department of Internal Medicine, General Hospital of Eastern Achaia, 25100 Aigio, Greece.; IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, 20089 Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, 20090 Milan, Italy.; Microbiology Department, ""Saint Savvas"" Oncology Hospital, 11522 Athens, Greece.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, ""Agios Panteleimon"" General Hospital of Nikea, 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, ""Agios Panteleimon"" General Hospital of Nikea, 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Neonatal Department, Aretaieio Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.; Laboratory of Haematology and Blood Bank Unit, ""Attiko"" Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 12462 Athens, Greece.; IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, 20089 Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, 20090 Milan, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, ""Agios Panteleimon"" General Hospital of Nikea, 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Neonatal Department, Aretaieio Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36498812,
The Effects of the COVID Pandemic on Patients with IBD: Lessons Learned and Future Directions.,Nov 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extended global disruption and changed healthcare behaviour and delivery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, many of whom take immune modifying treatment. Although there were fears about the vulnerability of IBD patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have learnt that overall IBD patients are equivalent to the general population in both viral acquisition and infection outcomes. Overall IBD patients obtain effective vaccine-induced immune responses, although in some groups an additional vaccine dose is required to constitute a primary course. The pandemic has led to significant changes in healthcare delivery, some of which will be enduring. As we grapple with the challenges of recovery, the lessons learnt will continue to be important in optimising outcomes in future outbreaks.","Zhang, Eva; Christensen, Britt; Macrae, Finlay Alistair; Leong, Rupert",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm11237002,36498577,"Department of Medicine, Macquarie University, Macquarie Park 2113, Australia.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Colorectal Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne 3050, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Macquarie University, Macquarie Park 2113, Australia.; Department of Gastroenterology, Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Concord 2137, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36498577,
Inflammatory bowel disease and COVID-19 outcomes: a meta-analysis.,Dec 2022,"There is conflicting evidence concerning the effect of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on COVID-19 incidence and outcome. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the published evidence through a systematic review process and perform a meta-analysis to assess the association between IBD and COVID-19. A compressive literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 2021. A snowball search in Google, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and MedRxiv; and bibliographic research were also performed to identify any other relevant articles. Quantitative observational studies such as cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that assessed the incidence, risk, and outcomes of COVID-19 among the adult IBD patients published in the English language, were considered for this review. The incidence and risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19, and mortality were considered as the outcomes of interest. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used for quality assessment. A subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the heterogeneity and robustness of the results, respectively. A total of 86 studies out of 2828 non-duplicate records were considered for this meta-analysis. The studies were single or multicentric internationally from settings such as IBD centres, medical colleges, hospitals, or from the general public. Most of the studies were observed to be of good quality with an acceptable risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, severe COVID-19, and mortality in the IBD population were 6.10%, 10.63%, 40.43%, and 1.94%, respectively. IBD was not significantly (p > 0.05) associated with the risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, severe COVID-19, and mortality. In contrast, ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 (OR 1.37; p = 0.01), COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 1.28; p < 0.00001), and severe COVID-19 (OR 2.45; p < 0.0007). Crohn's disease was significantly associated with a lesser risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 0.48; p = 0.02). Type of IBD was a potential factor that might have contributed to the higher level of heterogeneity. There was a significant association between ulcerative colitis and increased risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, and severe COVID-19 infection. This association was not observed in patients with Crohns' disease or in those diagnosed non-specifically as IBD.","Abdulla, Maheeba; Mohammed, Nafeesa; AlQamish, Jehad; Mosli, Mahmoud",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-022-25429-2,36494448,"Internal Medicine Department, Ibn AlNafees Hospital, Arabian Gulf University, Manama, Bahrain. amaheeba@hotmail.com.; Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Bahrain.; Internal Medicine Department, Ibn AlNafees Hospital, Arabian Gulf University, Manama, Bahrain.; Department of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36494448,

Molecular states during acute COVID-19 reveal distinct etiologies of long-term sequelae.,Jan 2023,"Post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are debilitating, clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. A transcriptome-wide investigation was performed in 165 acutely infected hospitalized individuals who were followed clinically into the post-acute period. Distinct gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during acute infection, with innate and adaptive immune cells implicated in different symptoms. Two clusters of sequelae exhibited divergent plasma-cell-associated gene expression patterns. In one cluster, sequelae associated with higher expression of immunoglobulin-related genes in an anti-spike antibody titer-dependent manner. In the other, sequelae associated independently of these titers with lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes, indicating lower non-specific antibody production in individuals with these sequelae. This relationship between lower total immunoglobulins and sequelae was validated in an external cohort. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were already detectable during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking these sequelae with the acute host response to the virus and providing early insights into their development.","Thompson, Ryan C; Simons, Nicole W; Wilkins, Lillian; Cheng, Esther; Del Valle, Diane Marie; Hoffman, Gabriel E; Cervia, Carlo; Fennessy, Brian; Mouskas, Konstantinos; Francoeur, Nancy J; Johnson, Jessica S; Lepow, Lauren; Le Berichel, Jessica; Chang, Christie; Beckmann, Aviva G; Wang, Ying-Chih; Nie, Kai; Zaki, Nicholas; Tuballes, Kevin; Barcessat, Vanessa; Cedillo, Mario A; Yuan, Dan; Huckins, Laura; Roussos, Panos; Marron, Thomas U; ,; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Nadkarni, Girish; Heath, James R; Gonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar; Boyman, Onur; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Sebra, Robert; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha; Schadt, Eric E; Charney, Alexander W; Beckmann, Noam D",Nature medicine,1546-170X,10.1038/s41591-022-02107-4,36482101,"Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Pamela Sklar Division of Psychiatric Genomics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Advanced Genomics Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Human Immune Monitoring Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Sema4, a Mount Sinai venture, Stamford, CT, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Advanced Genomics Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Human Immune Monitoring Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Human Immune Monitoring Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Pamela Sklar Division of Psychiatric Genomics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Disease Neurogenomics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center (VISN 2 South), James J.

A Prospective Questionnaire-Based Study to Evaluate Factors Affecting the Decision to Receive COVID-19 Vaccination in 267 Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Poland.,Dec 2022,"BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to assess the rate of COVID-19 vaccination and the attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Poland. An important aim of the study was to determine why some people get vaccinated and others refuse to do so. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a single-center, prospective survey. The study included 267 IBD patients who agreed to complete an anonymous questionnaire comprising 31 questions. RESULTS We found that 71.2% of the IBD patients had been vaccinated. The history of COVID-19 was associated with a lower vaccination rate (16.9% vs 36.8%; P=0.001), regardless of IBD severity. In the vaccinated group, there were more vaccinated people among household members (90.4% vs 43.4%; p<0.001) and friends (52.9% vs 22.4%; P<0.001). Family safety (71.1%), the desire to avoid COVID-19 (67.9%), social responsibility (60.5%), the desire to return to normal life (51.6%), and faith in vaccination as such (43.2%) were the most common reasons for vaccination. The most common cause of non-vaccination was concern about adverse effects (50.0%), including long-term adverse effects (36.8%), and about the possible exacerbation of gastroenterological disease (34.2%). CONCLUSIONS IBD patients are more likely to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 than the rest of the population in Poland. Young age, low socioeconomic status, low education, and living in the countryside were factors associated with lower vaccination rates. Family and friends had the greatest influence on the decision to vaccinate, but the influence of the mass media was very small.","Łodyga, Michał; Maciejewska, Katarzyna; Rydzewska, Grażyna",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,1643-3750,10.12659/MSM.938665,36474411,"Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subdivision, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subdivision, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subdivision, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration, Warsaw, Poland.; Collegium Medicum, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36474411,

Melatonin-Microbiome Two-Sided Interaction in Dysbiosis-Associated Conditions.,Nov 2022,"Melatonin is a pineal indolamine, allegedly known as a circadian rhythm regulator, and an antioxidative and immunomodulatory molecule. In both experimental and clinical trials, melatonin has been shown to have positive effects in various pathologies, as a modulator of important biochemical pathways including inflammation, oxidative stress, cell injury, apoptosis, and energy metabolism. The gut represents one of melatonin's most abundant extra pineal sources, with a 400-times-higher concentration than the pineal gland. The importance of the gut microbial community-namely, the gut microbiota, in multiple critical functions of the organism- has been extensively studied throughout time, and its imbalance has been associated with a variety of human pathologies. Recent studies highlight a possible gut microbiota-modulating role of melatonin, with possible implications for the treatment of these pathologies. Consequently, melatonin might prove to be a valuable and versatile therapeutic agent, as it is well known to elicit positive functions on the microbiota in many dysbiosis-associated conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronodisruption-induced dysbiosis, obesity, and neuropsychiatric disorders. This review intends to lay the basis for a deeper comprehension of melatonin, gut microbiota, and host-health subtle interactions.","Iesanu, Mara Ioana; Zahiu, Carmen Denise Mihaela; Dogaru, Ioana-Alexandra; Chitimus, Diana Maria; Pircalabioru, Gratiela Gradisteanu; Voiculescu, Suzana Elena; Isac, Sebastian; Galos, Felicia; Pavel, Bogdan; O'Mahony, Siobhain M; Zagrean, Ana-Maria","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2076-3921,10.3390/antiox11112244,36421432,"Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Pediatrics, Marie Curie Emergency Children's Hospital, 041451 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Section Earth, Environmental and Life Sciences, Research Institute of the University of Bucharest, 050663 Bucharest, Romania.; Academy of Romanian Scientists, 54 Splaiul Independentei Street, District 5, 050094 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care I, 'Fundeni' Clinical Institute, 022328 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Pediatrics, Marie Curie Emergency Children's Hospital, 041451 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Pediatrics, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University College Cork, T12 XF62 Cork, Ireland.; APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork, T12 YT20 Cork, Ireland.; Department of Functional Sciences, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 Bucharest, Romania.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36421432,

Effects of COVID-19 on Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Dec 2022,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may take medications that affect their immune system, altering their ability to fight infection or making them less responsive to vaccines. Many of these patients were excluded from original studies regarding COVID-19, which creates a challenge for gastroenterologists to use evidence-based medicine to guide their management. We reviewed the available literature regarding patients with IBD and COVID-19 outcomes and response to vaccinations. Of all IBD patients, 0.3-24% acquired COVID-19 infection and 7-67% of those patients required hospitalization. Many studies have analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on patients with IBD. Observational studies suggest most IBD patients are not at higher risk from COVID-19 infection and that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and recommended. However, patients being treated with a TNF-α inhibitor with an immunomodulator and patients being treated with steroids should be monitored closely and efforts should be made to wean patients off of systemic steroids if possible. Patients treated with these regimens had lower antibody responses to vaccination and were at higher risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 infection. Antibody responses were robust after the second dose of mRNA vaccines with 85-100% of individuals showing seroconversion, albeit with lower levels of antibodies compared to the general population.","Kogan, Lawrence; Ungaro, Ryan C; Caldera, Freddy; Shah, Samir A",Rhode Island medical journal (2013),2327-2228,,36413451,"Clinical Fellow, Department of Digestive Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; The Henry D.

Application and development of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases: A review.,2023,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a balanced intestinal flora, which helps to cure recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (RCDI). FMT has also been used to treat other gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and chronic constipation, as well as a variety of non-GI disorders. The purpose of this review is to discuss gut microbiota and FMT treatment of GI and non-GI diseases. An imbalanced gut microbiota is known to predispose one to Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), IBD, and IBS. However, the complex role of the gut microbiota in maintaining health is a newer concept that is being increasingly studied. The microbiome plays a major role in cellular immunity and metabolism and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-GI autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, and even some neuropsychiatric disorders. Many recent studies have reported that viral gastroenteritis can affect intestinal epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been identified in the stool of infected patients. FMT is a highly effective cure for RCDI, but a better understanding of the gut microbiota in maintaining health and controlled studies of FMT in a variety of conditions are needed before FMT can be accepted and used clinically.","Mahmoudi, Hassan; Hossainpour, Hadi",Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,1998-4049,10.4103/sjg.sjg_131_22,36412458,"Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Department of Nursing and Paramedical, Nahavand School of Allied Medical Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.; Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36412458,
"COVID-19 Vaccination Among Individuals With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Perception, Efficacy, and Safety.",Jul 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARSCoV-2, has been the most significant global health crisis of the past century. The development of safe and effective vaccines has led to a reduction in COVID19-related hospitalizations and deaths; however, the clinical trials that led to US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization and/or approval of the vaccines in the United States did not include individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because individuals with IBD are commonly treated with immunosuppressive medications, there had been concern for reduced vaccine efficacy in this population. This article provides an overview of the peer-reviewed literature addressing COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with IBD; details the perceptions of patients with IBD of COVID-19 vaccines, including how gastroenterologists can help to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and describes the humoral immune response to COVID-19 vaccines, with a majority of patients with IBD seroconverting following complete vaccination regardless of medication exposure. Additionally, low rates of IBD flare and similar rates of vaccine-related adverse events to those in the general population are described. Finally, the article provides current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with IBD.","Weaver, Kimberly N; Kappelman, Michael D; Long, Millie D",Gastroenterology & hepatology,1554-7914,,36397773,"Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36397773,

A Multidisciplinary Approach and Current Perspective of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review.,Sep 2022,"In recent times, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been considered one of the major causes of liver disease across the world. NAFLD is defined as the deposition of triglycerides in the liver and is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), fatty liver, hepatocyte injury, unbalanced proinflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, and fibrosis are the main pathogenesis in NAFLD. Recent studies suggest that the action of intestinal microbiota through chronic inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and energy uptake plays a vital role in NAFLD. Moreover, polycystic ovarian syndrome also causes NAFLD development through IR. Age, gender, race, ethnicity, sleep, diet, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic and epigenetic pathways are some contributing factors of NAFLD that can exacerbate the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and eventually lead to death. NAFLD has various presentations, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bloating, upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, poor sleep, increased thirst, palpitation, and a feeling of warmth. Some studies have shown that NAFLD with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has poor outcomes. The gold standard for NAFLD diagnosis is liver biopsy. Other diagnostic tools are imaging tests, serum biomarkers, microbiota markers, and tests for extrahepatic complications. There are no specific treatments for NAFLD. Therefore, the main concern for NAFLD is treating the comorbid conditions such as anti-diabetic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus, statins to reduce HCC progression, antioxidants to prevent hepatocellular damage, and bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI of >40 kg/m","Zaman, Chowdhury F; Sultana, Jakia; Dey, Proma; Dutta, Jui; Mustarin, Sadia; Tamanna, Nuzhat; Roy, Aditi; Bhowmick, Nisha; Khanam, Mousumi; Sultana, Sadia; Chowdhury, Selia; Khanam, Farjana; Sakibuzzaman, Md; Dutta, Priyata",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.29657,36320966,"Medicine and Surgery, Jahurul Islam Medical College and Hospital, Kishoreganj, BGD.; Medicine, Comilla Medical College, Cumilla, BGD.; Internal Medicine, Chittagong Medical College, Chattogram, BGD.; Medicine, Comilla Medical College, Cumilla, BGD.; Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, BGD.; Medicine, Rangpur Medical College and Hospital, Rangpur, BGD.; Medicine, Sher-e-Bangla Medical College, Barisal, BGD.; Medicine, Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College, Bogra, BGD.; Internal Medicine, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, BGD.; Medicine, Anwer Khan Modern Medical College, Dhaka, BGD.; Internal Medicine, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, BGD.; Medicine, Central Medical College, Cumilla, BGD.; Neurology, The University of Toledo, Toledo, USA.; Internal Medicine, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, USA.; Internal Medicine, Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka, BGD.; Experimental Pathology (Cancer Biology), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.; Internal Medicine, Trinity Health, St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36320966,
Questionnaire-Based Study of 81 Patients in Poland to Evaluate the Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Quality of Life and Mental State from February to June 2021.,Nov 2022,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic affected many people worldwide, including those with chronic diseases. Our objective was to analyze its influence on medical care and the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 2021, 81 patients in Poland with IBD completed an original anonymous questionnaire about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of their disease and mental status. The printed questionnaire was distributed to IBD patients treated at the Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of the University Clinical Hospital in Białystok, and an online questionnaire was sent to patients via social media. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test, with a significance level of P<0.05. RESULTS The study group consisted of 46 women and 35 men with a mean age of 32.42 years. Fifty-nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 22 had Crohn disease. Patients reported significant deterioration in medication availability (50.62%) and restricted access to gastroenterology outpatient clinics (51.90%) (P<0.05). Of patients who contracted COVID-19, 89.47% did not require hospitalization, 32.10% (26/81) were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate, despite immunosuppressive biological treatment (27.16%, 22/81), or steroids (18.52%, 15/81). Over 50% of respondents stated the pandemic negatively affected their mental state and 30% of them associated that with worsening IBD. CONCLUSIONS During the pandemic, respondents were mainly concerned with difficulties in accessing the gastroenterology clinic and limited drug availability. The pandemic negatively affected patients' mental state. In cases of COVID-19 disease, patients with IBD were mostly asymptomatic and did not require hospitalization, despite therapy affecting the immune system.","Owsianko, Natalia; Romańczuk-Osenka, Natalia; Szczerbakow, Martyna; Pikora, Katarzyna; Sowa, Katarzyna; Daniluk, Urszula; Rogalski, Paweł; Świdnicka-Siergiejko, Agnieszka; Antonowicz, Stefania; Krzyżak, Michalina; Maślach, Dominik; Dąbrowski, Andrzej; Daniluk, Jarosław",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,1643-3750,10.12659/MSM.938243,36316965,"Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Nutrition and Allergology with the Pulmonology Subdivision, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Ergonomics, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Public Health, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.; Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Białystok, Białystok, Poland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36316965,

Impact of Anti-TNFα Treatment on the Humoral Response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.,Sep 2022,"The efficacy of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, including the third vaccination in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) patients is not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the changes in durability until 20-28 weeks after the initial vaccine series in PIBD patients on immunosuppressive drugs. The safety of the initial vaccine series and the booster effect of the third vaccination were also evaluated.

All PIBD patients were seroconverted, with no serious short-term AEs. PIBD patients on anti-TNFα had significantly lower antibody titers than those on other medications at all measurement points. Furthermore, antibody titers waned over time with anti-TNFα and were significantly lower at 20-28 weeks than at 3-9 weeks after a two-vaccine series. In all 10 patients (anti-TNFα: 5; non-anti-TNFα including 5-ASA: 5), the third vaccination led to antibody concentrations significantly higher than those at the same time point after the second vaccination.

COVID-19 and Gut Injury.,Oct 2022,"COVID-19 induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic and it has led to more than 620 million patients with 6.56 million deaths globally. Males are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and associated with a higher chance to develop severe COVID-19 than females. Aged people are at a high risk of COVID-19 infection, while young children have also increased cases. COVID-19 patients typically develop respiratory system pathologies, however symptoms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are also very common. Inflammatory cell recruitments and their secreted cytokines are found in the GI tract in COVID-19 patients. Microbiota changes are the key feature in COVID-19 patients with gut injury. Here, we review all current known mechanisms of COVID-19-induced gut injury, and the most acceptable one is that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells in the GI tract. Interestingly, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder, but the patients with IBD do not have the increased risk to develop COVID-19. There is currently no cure for COVID-19, but anti-viruses and monoclonal antibodies reduce viral load and shorten the recovery time of the disease. We summarize current therapeutics that target symptoms in the GI tract, including probiotics, ACE2 inhibitors and nutrients. These are promising therapeutic options for COVID-19-induced gut injury.","Shen, Sj; Gong, Muxue; Wang, Gang; Dua, Kamal; Xu, Jincheng; Xu, Xiaoyue; Liu, Gang",Nutrients,2072-6643,10.3390/nu14204409,36297092,"UNSW Microbiome Research Centre, St George and Sutherland Clinical Campus, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2217, Australia.; School of Clinical Medicine, Bengbu Medicine College, Bengbu 233030, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.; Discipline of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.; Faculty of Health, Australian Research Centre in Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.; Stomatology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233004, China.; School of Dental Medicine, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, China.; School of Population Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.; Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36297092,
The Changes in Trends of Lower Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Conducted in Children and Adolescents after the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea.,Oct 2022,"Background and Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected medical practice in diverse ways. We aimed to investigate the change in trends of lower gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy conducted in children and adolescents after the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. Material and Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective study conducted in Korea. We included children and adolescents aged <19 years who had undergone their first LGI endoscopy between 2016 and 2020. We compared clinicodemographic and endoscopic factors between groups divided according to the pre- and postCOVID-19 era in Korea. Results: We included 1307 patients in this study. Colonoscopies, instead of sigmoidoscopies, were conducted in most patients in the postCOVID-19 era compared to those in the preCOVID-19 era (86.9% vs. 78.5%, p = 0.007). The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was also significantly higher in the postCOVID-19 era compared to the preCOVID-19 era (47.2% vs. 28.5%, p < 0.001). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, age at LGI endoscopy, LGI bleeding indication, and IBD diagnosis were independently associated with the use of a colonoscopy over a sigmoidoscopy (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12−1.27, p < 0.001; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37−0.83, p = 0.005; OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.20−2.77, p = 0.006, respectively). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed LGI endoscopy practice trends of pediatric gastroenterologists in Korea, who tended to perform lesser LGI endoscopies compared to previous years while conducting significantly more colonoscopies than sigmoidoscopies in the postCOVID-19 era. Furthermore, these colonoscopies were significantly associated with the diagnosis of IBD, as well as a significant increase in IBD diagnosis in the postCOVID-19 era.","Lee, Sang Woo; Kang, Ben; Choi, Sujin; Choe, Byung-Ho; Kim, Yu Bin; Lee, Kyung Jae; Kim, Hyun Jin; Jang, Hyo-Jeong; Choi, So Yoon; Yi, Dae Yong; Choi, You Jin; Kim, Ju Young; Lee, Eun Hye; Lee, Yoo Min","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",1648-9144,10.3390/medicina58101378,36295539,"Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu 41944, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu 41944, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu 41944, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu 41944, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University School of Medicine, 164, World Cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon 16499, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University College of Medicine, 1 Hallymdaehak-gil, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam National University Hospital, 282 Munhwa-ro, Jung-gu, Daejeon 35015, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University School of Medicine, 1035, Dalgubeol-daero, Dalseo-gu, Daegu 42601, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Kosin University College of Medicine, 262 Gamcheon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 49267, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, 102, Heukseok-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul 06973, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital, Juhwa-ro 170, Ilsanseo-gu, Goyang 10380, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Eulji University Hospital, 95, Dunsanseo-ro, Seo-gu, Daejeon 35233, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Nowon Eulji Medical Center, Eulji University School of Medicine, 68, Hangeulbiseok-ro, Nowon-gu, Seoul 01830, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, 170, Jomaru-ro, Bucheon 14584, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36295539,
Aseptic Abscess Syndrome in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient.,Sep 2022,"Aseptic abscess syndrome (AAS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening disorder, with numerous features of neutrophilic dermatoses. The main symptoms include aseptic abscess-like collections in internal organs (spleen, liver, lungs), lack of microbes (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) after an exhaustive search, ineffectiveness of antibiotics, and high sensitivity to corticosteroid therapy. AAS is characterized by the development of deep, inflammatory abscesses and systemic symptoms (weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis). They may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune diseases. The patient in this study is a 67-year-old man, suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with numerous purulent abscesses in the mediastinum, within the subcutaneous tissue above the extension surfaces of the joints, and on the dorsum of the hands. The lesions are accompanied by bone destruction. The patient was treated with prednisone 40 mg and adalimumab, which resulted in a quick reduction of inflammatory markers and clinical improvement, as well as the healing and absorption of abscesses. Despite COVID-19 infection, treatment with remdesivir, prednisone, and adalimumab was continued, with the complete resolution of the lesions.

The possibility of using psyllium (Mucofalk) is reflected, the action of which is realized both through its sorption, cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in viral lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and through stimulation of the own beneficial intestinal microbiota. The paper presents studies of the prospects for the use of probiotics, synbiotics in the complex therapy of patients with COVID-19. Detailed data are provided on the mechanisms of the positive effect of short-chain fatty acid preparations on reducing the severity of the disease in patients with COVID-19. It was noted that taking the drug Zacofalk leads to a significant increase in its own butyrate-producing microbiota (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and suppression of the growth of opportunistic flora with pro-inflammatory activity. The results of a recent study are presented showing that in patients with a mild course of COVID infection with respiratory and intestinal symptoms, the administration of Zakofalk for 30 days (3 tablets per day) led to significantly faster stool normalization (by day 7), persistent normalization of the frequency and consistency of stools by the 21st day and a significantly more pronounced regression of bloating and abdominal pain, as well as a decrease in the risk of developing post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.","Akhmedov, V A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,0040-3660,10.26442/00403660.2022.02.201388,36286750,Omsk State Medical University.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36286750,

COVID-19 induces gastrointestinal symptoms and affects patients' prognosis.,Oct 2022,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is common among patients with COVID-19, and GI symptoms can appear earlier than respiratory symptoms. Except for direct infectious effects, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of complications requiring gastroenterological management. Diarrhea is the most common GI symptom in patients with COVID-19 and occurs in up to half of them. Other GI symptoms, such as anorexia, discomfort, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of taste sensation, and vomiting, have been reported. GI symptoms are associated with a poor prognosis. Fecal viral excretion may have clinical significance because of the possible fecal-oral transmission of infection. In the present narrative review article, six different aspects of studies published to date are summarized as follows: GI manifestations of COVID-19, the roles of fecal-oral transmission, poor prognosis of GI symptoms; abnormal abdominal imaging findings, COVID-19 in patients with irritable bowel disease, and prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the digestive endoscopy room.

"C-reactive protein, immunothrombosis and venous thromboembolism.",2022,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a member of the highly conserved pentraxin superfamily of proteins and is often used in clinical practice as a marker of infection and inflammation. There is now increasing evidence that CRP is not only a marker of inflammation, but also that destabilized isoforms of CRP possess pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic properties. CRP circulates as a functionally inert pentameric form (pCRP), which relaxes its conformation to pCRP* after binding to phosphocholine-enriched membranes and then dissociates to monomeric CRP (mCRP). with the latter two being destabilized isoforms possessing highly pro-inflammatory features. pCRP* and mCRP have significant biological effects in regulating many of the aspects central to pathogenesis of atherothrombosis and venous thromboembolism (VTE), by directly activating platelets and triggering the classical complement pathway. Importantly, it is now well appreciated that VTE is a consequence of thromboinflammation. Accordingly, acute VTE is known to be associated with classical inflammatory responses and elevations of CRP, and indeed VTE risk is elevated in conditions associated with inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, COVID-19 and sepsis. Although the clinical data regarding the utility of CRP as a biomarker in predicting VTE remains modest, and in some cases conflicting, the clinical utility of CRP appears to be improved in subsets of the population such as in predicting VTE recurrence, in cancer-associated thrombosis and in those with COVID-19. Therefore, given the known biological function of CRP in amplifying inflammation and tissue damage, this raises the prospect that CRP may play a role in promoting VTE formation in the context of concurrent inflammation. However, further investigation is required to unravel whether CRP plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of VTE, the utility of which will be in developing novel prophylactic or therapeutic strategies to target thromboinflammation.","Dix, Caroline; Zeller, Johannes; Stevens, Hannah; Eisenhardt, Steffen U; Shing, Karen S Cheung Tung; Nero, Tracy L; Morton, Craig J; Parker, Michael W; Peter, Karlheinz; McFadyen, James D",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1002652,36177015,"Department of Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Atherothrombosis and Vascular Biology Program, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Atherothrombosis and Vascular Biology Program, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Biomedical Manufacturing Program, Clayton, VIC, Australia.; Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Structural Biology Unit, St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, VIC, Australia.; Atherothrombosis and Vascular Biology Program, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Department of Cardiology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Atherothrombosis and Vascular Biology Program, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36177015,

Gastrointestinal System: COVID-19 and Potential Mechanisms Associated with Coagulopathy.,2022,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that expanded worldwide, generating a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome called ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19), which resulted in a global health crisis. The spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations ranges from none or mild symptoms to severe respiratory failure associated with systemic manifestations, mostly gastrointestinal symptoms. Hypercoagulability is an important feature of COVID-19 disease, which can potentially influence patients' prognosis. Therefore, gastroenterologists should focus on subjects with concomitant hypercoagulable gastrointestinal disorders as they may display a higher risk of thrombotic complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence regarding the interplay of the prothrombotic pathogenetic mechanisms of both COVID-19 and hypercoagulable digestive diseases and the possible clinical implications.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Initiation of Immunosuppressive Treatment in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases in Austria: A Nationwide Retrospective Study.,Sep 2022,"Objective: Conventional immunosuppressive and advanced targeted therapies, including biological medications and small molecules, are a mainstay in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused concerns over these drugs’ safety regarding the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the initiation of these treatments in 2020. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis of real-world data of the Austrian health insurance funds on the initiation of conventional immunosuppressive and advanced targeted therapies. The primary objective was to compare the initiation of these medications in the year 2020 with the period 2017 to 2019. Initiation rates of medication were calculated by comparing a certain unit of time with an average of the previous ones. Results: 95,573 patients were included. During the first lockdown in Austria in April 2020, there was a significant decrease in the initiations of conventional immunosuppressives and advanced targeted therapies compared to previous years (p < 0.0001). From May 2020 onwards, numbers rapidly re-achieved pre-lockdown levels despite higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and subsequent lockdown periods at the end of 2020. Independent from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a continuous increase of starts of advanced targeted therapies and a continuous decrease of conventional immunosuppressants during the observation period were observed. Conclusions: In IMID patients, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant decrease of newly started conventional immunosuppressive and advanced targeted therapies only during the first lockdown in Austria.","Kutschera, Maximilian; Ritschl, Valentin; Reichardt, Berthold; Stamm, Tanja; Kiener, Hans; Maier, Harald; Reinisch, Walter; Benka, Bernhard; Novacek, Gottfried",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm11185308,36142955,"Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Arthritis and Rehabilitation, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Austrian Health Insurance Fund, 7000 Eisenstadt, Austria.; Institute of Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Arthritis and Rehabilitation, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Rheumatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; AGES-Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety Ltd., Division of Public Health, 1220 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36142955,

We report a case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by portal vein thrombosis and resultant hepatic infarction, splenic vein thrombosis, bilateral renal infarction, and bowel hypoperfusion in an 81-year-old man with recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of such extensive intra-abdominal thromboses complicating severe acute pancreatitis. Despite multi-organ support and systemic anticoagulation, he deteriorated into multiple organ failure and died after 72 hours. He had no prior history of thrombotic disorders. COVID-19 infection can cause sustained prothrombotic changes, while severe acute pancreatitis also produces an inflammatory response that promotes coagulation. Together, the two concurrent disease processes may have resulted in the particularly extensive intra-abdominal thromboses and infarctions seen in this patient.

Nucleic acid strategies for infectious disease treatments: The nanoparticle-based oral delivery route.,2022,"Therapies based on orally administrated nucleic acids have significant potential for the treatment of infectious diseases, including chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and infectious and acute contagious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is because nucleic acids could precisely regulate susceptibility genes in regulating the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines expression related to the infections. Unfortunately, gene delivery remains a major hurdle due to multiple intracellular and extracellular barriers. This review thoroughly discusses the challenges of nanoparticle-based nucleic acid gene deliveries and strategies for overcoming delivery barriers to the inflammatory sites.

Inefficient Induction of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease on Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy after Receiving a Third mRNA Vaccine Dose.,Aug 2022,"Management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often relies on biological and immunomodulatory agents for remission through immunosuppression, raising concerns regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine's effectiveness. The emergent variants have hindered the vaccine neutralization capacity, and whether the third vaccine dose can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants in this population remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the humoral response of SARS-CoV-2 variants in patients with IBD 60 days after the third vaccine dose [BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna)]. Fifty-six subjects with IBD and 12 healthy subjects were recruited. Ninety percent of patients with IBD (49/56) received biologics and/or immunomodulatory therapy. Twenty-four subjects with IBD did not develop effective neutralizing capability against the Omicron variant. Seventy percent (17/24) of those subjects received anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy [10 = adalimumab, 7 = infliximab], two of which had a history of COVID-19 infection, and one subject did not develop immune neutralization against three other variants: Gamma, Epsilon, and Kappa. All subjects in the control group developed detectable antibodies and effective neutralization against all seven SARS-CoV-2 variants.

"Neutralizing Antibody Response, Safety, and Efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective Multicenter Case-Control Study.",Aug 2022,"The vaccination of immunocompromised children against coronavirus disease 2019 is an important public health issue. We evaluated the serological response, safety, and efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine in children with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective, multicenter, case-control study was conducted in a pediatric population, including patients with IBD, aged 12-18 years. Clinical characteristics, safety profile, and serum samples for surrogate virus-neutralizing antibody testing pre- and post-BNT162b2 vaccination were assessed. The breakthrough infection rate during the Omicron outbreak was calculated to evaluate efficacy. Fifteen controls and twenty-three patients with IBD were enrolled. After two vaccine doses, the median level of percentage inhibition was highly increased, without significant differences between the groups (control 96.9 and IBD 96.3). However, it was significantly reduced in IBD patients receiving combination therapy (anti-tumor necrosis factor-α + immunomodulators) relative to those in other therapies and controls. Serious adverse events were not observed. The breakthrough infection rate was 42.1%, without statistical differences between the groups. Immunization with BNT162b2 in patients with IBD was comparable with that in healthy adolescents in terms of immunogenicity and safety. Nevertheless, the efficacy of BNT162b2 in preventing infection caused by the Omicron variant in the pediatric population was insufficient.","Lee, Kyung Jae; Choi, So Yoon; Lee, Yoo Min; Kim, Han Wool",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines10081265,36016153,"Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang 14068, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan 49267, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Bucheon 14584, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang 14068, Korea.; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36016153,

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 receptor bind and activate SARS-CoV-2 and are present in high concentrations throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Most patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or abnormal liver function tests, both of which have been associated with adverse outcomes. The mechanisms of liver damage are currently under investigation, but the damage is usually transient and nonsevere. Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for acute liver failure and end-stage liver disease, and unfortunately, because of the need for ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic, most liver transplant programs have been suspended. Patients with gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases require close follow-up and may need modification in immunosuppression. Acute pancreatitis is a rare manifestation of COVID-19, but it must be considered in patients with abdominal pain.

Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic target of NETosis in diseases.,Sep 2022,"Evidence shows that neutrophils can protect the host against pathogens in multiple ways, including the formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are web-like structures composed of fibers, DNA, histones, and various neutrophil granule proteins. NETs can capture and kill pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The process of NET formation is called NETosis. According to whether they depend on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), NETosis can be divided into two categories: ""suicidal"" NETosis and ""vital"" NETosis. However, NET components, including neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and cell-free DNA, cause a proinflammatory response and potentially severe diseases. Compelling evidence indicates a link between NETs and the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, small-vessel vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, COVID-19, and others. Therefore, targeting the process and products of NETosis is critical for treating diseases linked with NETosis. Researchers have discovered that several NET inhibitors, such as toll-like receptor inhibitors and reactive oxygen species scavengers, can prevent uncontrolled NET development. This review summarizes the mechanism of NETosis, the receptors associated with NETosis, the pathology of NETosis-induced diseases, and NETosis-targeted therapy.","Huang, Jiayu; Hong, Weiqi; Wan, Meihua; Zheng, Limin",MedComm,2688-2663,10.1002/mco2.162,36000086,Laboratory of Aging Research and Cancer Drug Target State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics West China Hospital Sichuan University Chengdu China.; Laboratory of Aging Research and Cancer Drug Target State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics West China Hospital Sichuan University Chengdu China.; Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine West China Hospital Sichuan University Chengdu Sichuan China.; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Functional Genes MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation School of Life Sciences Sun Yat-Sen University Guangzhou China.; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center Guangzhou China.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36000086,

COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease crosstalk: From emerging association to clinical proposal.,Dec 2022,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory inflammation that has emerged worldwide since December 2019, and it quickly became a global epidemic. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory diseases whose etiology has not been elucidated. The two have many overlapping symptoms in clinical presentation, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, pneumonia, etc. Imbalance of the autoimmune system in IBD patients and long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of infection; and systemic symptoms caused by COVID-19 may also induce or exacerbate intestinal inflammation. It has been found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is highly expressed in the lung and intestine, is an inflammatory protective factor, and is downregulated and upregulated in COVID-19 and IBD, respectively, suggesting that there may be a coregulatory pathway. In addition, the immune activation pattern of COVID-19 and the cytokine storm in the inflammatory response have similar roles in IBD, indicating that the two diseases may influence each other. Therefore, this review aimed to address the following research questions: whether SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the progression of IBD; whether IBD increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and poor prognosis; possible common mechanisms and genetic cross-linking between the two diseases; new treatment and care strategies for IBD patients, and the feasibility and risk of vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Tao, Sha-Sha; Wang, Xin-Yi; Yang, Xiao-Ke; Liu, Yu-Chen; Fu, Zi-Yue; Zhang, Li-Zhi; Wang, Zhi-Xin; Ni, Jing; Shuai, Zong-Wen; Pan, Hai-Feng",Journal of medical virology,1096-9071,10.1002/jmv.28067,35971954,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, First Clinical Medical College, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Otolaryngology, Head, and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, The First School of Clinical Medicine, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35971954,
Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Mar 2022,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is one of three structurally similar beta-coronaviruses that can cause a strong upregulation of cytokines referred to as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Unresolved CRS leads to respiratory symptoms, including pneumonia, and in more severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although COVID-19 is widely known for these hallmark respiratory symptoms, it also impacts the gut, causing gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation and diarrhea. COVID-19's GI symptoms may be due to the high intestinal expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors, which are for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be passed through fecal matter, with one study finding that 48.1% of COVID-19 patients expressed viral SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in their stool. Given that the GI tract is a target tissue affected by COVID-19, this causes concern for those with underlying GI pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Regrettably, there have been only limited studies on the impact of COVID-19 on gut health, and the impact of COVID-19 on intestinal inflammation among IBD patients remains unclear. In particular, questions regarding susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical impact of COVID-19 on IBD, and the potential influence of age, sex, and immunosuppressant medications are still poorly understood. An improved understanding of these issues is needed to address the unique risks of COVID-19 among IBD patients, as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the host intestinal microbiota.","Ambrose, Paula A; Goodman, Wendy A",Journal of exploratory research in pharmacology,2572-5505,10.14218/jerp.2021.00014,35966234,"Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, OH, USA.; Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, OH, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35966234,

"Pathogenic role of cytokines in COVID-19, its association with contributing co-morbidities and possible therapeutic regimens.",Oct 2022,"The Covid-19, a threatening pandemic, was originated from China in December 2019 and spread quickly to all over the world. The pathogenesis of coronavirus is linked with the disproportionate response of the immune system. This involves the systemic inflammatory reaction which is characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release commonly known as cytokine release storm (CRS). The pro inflammatory cytokines are involved in cascade of pulmonary inflammation, hyper coagulation and thrombosis which may be lethal for the individual. That's why, it is very important to have understanding of pro inflammatory cytokines and their pathological role in SARS-CoV-2. The pathogenesis of Covid is not the same in every individual, it can vary due to the presence of pre-existing comorbidities like suffering from already an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an immune-compromised patients suffering from Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Tuberculosis (TB) are more vulnerable morbidity and complications following COVID-19. This review is particularly related to COVID-19 patients having comorbidity of other inflammatory diseases. We have discussed the brief pathogenesis of COVID-19 and cytokines release storm with reference to other co-morbidities including RA, IBD, COPD, DM and TB. The available therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 including cytokine inhibitors, anti-viral, anti-biotic, bronchodilators, JAK- inhibitors, immunomodulators and anti-fibrotic agents have also been discussed briefly. Moreover, newly emerging medicines in the clinical trials have also been discussed which are found to be effective in treating Covid-19.","Tanveer, Ayesha; Akhtar, Bushra; Sharif, Ali; Saleem, Uzma; Rasul, Azhar; Ahmad, Aftab; Jilani, Kashif",Inflammopharmacology,1568-5608,10.1007/s10787-022-01040-9,35948809,"Institute of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan.; Department of Pharmacy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan.

Vaccination strategies for Korean patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Sep 2022,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are vulnerable to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Immunosuppressive drugs, which are often used to manage IBD, may increase this vulnerability and attenuate vaccine efficacy. Thus, healthcare providers should understand infectious diseases and schedule vaccinations for them to reduce the infection-related burden of patients with IBD. All patients with IBD should be assessed in terms of immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases at the time of IBD diagnosis, and be vaccinated appropriately. Vaccination is becoming more important because of the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health crisis.

A young male presented with cutaneous IgA vasculitis with glomerular hematuria, diarrhea and pericarditis following his second COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. He also showed positivity for proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) and anti-cardiolipin antibody. Skin biopsy was compatible to IgA vasculitis. His purpura subsided and hematuria spontaneously disappeared. Treatment with anti-inflammatory medications and prednisolone resolved the pericarditis. He had a history of persistent diarrhea, and colonic biopsies showed possible ulcerative colitis without vasculitis. Kidney biopsy after prednisolone therapy revealed minor glomerular abnormalities without any immune reactants and did not show vasculitis. After prednisolone treatment, PR3-ANCA decreased in a medium degree despite of improvement of symptoms and inflammatory data, suggesting that his PR3-ANCA may be associated with ulcerative colitis. The cause of the transient glomerular hematuria was unclear, however, it might be caused by focal glomerular active lesions (glomerular vasculitis) due to vaccine-induced IgA vasculitis with nephritis. This case highlights that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination can activate multiple autoimmune/autoinflammatory systems.

Gut microbiota-derived metabolites confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2022,"The gut microbiome is intricately coupled with immune regulation and metabolism, but its role in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood. Severe and fatal COVID-19 is characterized by poor anti-viral immunity and hypercoagulation, particularly in males. Here, we define multiple pathways by which the gut microbiome protects mammalian hosts from SARS-CoV-2 intranasal infection, both locally and systemically, via production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs reduced viral burdens in the airways and intestines by downregulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and enhancing adaptive immunity via GPR41 and 43 in male animals. We further identify a novel role for the gut microbiome in regulating systemic coagulation response by limiting megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet turnover via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis. Taken together, our findings have unraveled novel functions of SCFAs and fiber-fermenting gut bacteria to dampen viral entry and hypercoagulation and promote adaptive antiviral immunity.","Brown, Julia A; Sanidad, Katherine Z; Lucotti, Serena; Lieber, Carolin M; Cox, Robert M; Ananthanarayanan, Aparna; Basu, Srijani; Chen, Justin; Shan, Mengrou; Amir, Mohammed; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Cioffi, Michele; Li, Tingting; Rowdo, Florencia Madorsky; Martin, M Laura; Guo, Chun-Jun; Lyssiotis, Costas; Layden, Brian T; Dannenberg, Andrew J; Bieniasz, Paul D; Lee, Benhur; Inohara, Naohiro; Matei, Irina; Plemper, Richard K; Zeng, Melody Y",Gut microbes,1949-0984,10.1080/19490976.2022.2105609,35915556,"Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University; Atlanta, GA, United States of America.; Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University; Atlanta, GA, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University; New York, NY, United States of America.; Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University; New York, NY, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Jill Roberts Institute for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Jill Roberts Institute for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, University of Illinois at Chicago; Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University; New York, NY, United States of America.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University; New York, NY, United States of America.; Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY, United States of America.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan; Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.; Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University; Atlanta, GA, United States of America.; Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine; New York, NY, United States of America.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35915556,

Anti-TNFα Treatment Impairs Long-Term Immune Responses to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,Jul 2022,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with anti-tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) exhibited lower serologic responses one-month following the second dose of the COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine compared to those not treated with anti-TNFα (non-anti-TNFα) or to healthy controls (HCs). We comprehensively analyzed long-term humoral responses, including anti-spike (S) antibodies, serum inhibition, neutralization, cross-reactivity and circulating B cell six months post BNT162b2, in patients with IBD stratified by therapy compared to HCs. Subjects enrolled in a prospective, controlled, multi-center Israeli study received two BNT162b2 doses. Anti-S levels, functional activity, specific B cells, antigen cross-reactivity, anti-nucleocapsid levels, adverse events and IBD disease score were detected longitudinally. In total, 240 subjects, 151 with IBD (94 not treated with anti-TNFα and 57 treated with anti-TNFα) and 89 HCs participated. Six months after vaccination, patients with IBD treated with anti-TNFα had significantly impaired BNT162b2 responses, specifically, more seronegativity, decreased specific circulating B cells and cross-reactivity compared to patients untreated with anti-TNFα. Importantly, all seronegative subjects were patients with IBD; of those, >90% were treated with anti-TNFα. Finally, IBD activity was unaffected by BNT162b2. Altogether these data support the earlier booster dose administration in these patients.","Rabinowitz, Keren Masha; Navon, Michal; Edelman-Klapper, Hadar; Zittan, Eran; Bar-Gil Shitrit, Ariella; Goren, Idan;

The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV2 vaccination is still largely unknown in adolescents or young adults affected by IBD (pIBD). We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 27 pIBD, as compared to 30 healthy controls (HC). Immunogenicity was measured by anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG (anti-S and anti-trim Ab) before vaccination, after 21 days (T21) and 7 days after the second dose (T28). The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported adverse events. Vaccination was well tolerated, and short-term adverse events reported were only mild to moderate. Three out of twenty-seven patients showed IBD flare after vaccination, but no causal relationship could be established. Overall, pIBD showed a good humoral response upon vaccination compared to HC; however, pIBD on anti-TNFα treatment showed lower anti-S Ab titers compared to patients receiving other immune-suppressive regimens (","Cotugno, Nicola; Franzese, Enrica; Angelino, Giulia; Amodio, Donato; Romeo, Erminia Francesca; Rea, Francesca; Faraci, Simona; Tambucci, Renato; Profeti, Elisa; Manno, Emma Concetta; Santilli, Veronica; Rotulo, Gioacchino Andrea; Pighi, Chiara; Medri, Chiara; Morrocchi, Elena; Colagrossi, Luna; Pascucci, Giuseppe Rubens; Valentini, Diletta; Villani, Alberto; Rossi, Paolo; De Angelis, Paola; Palma, Paolo",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines10071109,35891273,"Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Chair of Pediatrics, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00185 Rome, Italy.; The School of Pediatrics, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; The School of Pediatrics, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), University of Genoa, 16126 Genoa, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Pediatric Unit, Pediatric Emergency Department (DEA), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Chair of Pediatrics, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00185 Rome, Italy.; Pediatric Unit, Pediatric Emergency Department (DEA), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Chair of Pediatrics, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00185 Rome, Italy.; Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Digestive Endoscopy and Surgery Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Academic Department of Pediatrics (DPUO), Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00165 Rome, Italy.; Chair of Pediatrics, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00185 Rome, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891273,
Effects of Different Biological Therapies on S1/S2 Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in a Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Jul 2022,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has affected the entire planet. The objectives of our study were to compare responses to the vaccine (Pfizer-Biontech COMIRNATY) in a population of patients with intestinal bowel syndrome undergoing different biological therapies or conventional therapy. The study recruited 390 patients who received the first vaccination dose during the dedicated vaccination campaign for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of CD or UC and complete vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (Comirnaty) vaccine. The exclusion criteria were other significant diseases or important therapies under way or contraindications to vaccination according to the European drug surveillance recommendations. Linear rank models were run to assess the association between the different therapies and S1/S2 antibodies at three different times. The models showed that in patients with IBD receiving Vedolizumab a significant increase in mean IgG levels was observed, independently of other therapies and confounding factors (β: 57.45, 95% CI 19.62 to 19.00). This study confirmed the complete antibody response to vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with IBD undergoing biological therapy-particularly Vedolizumab treatment-but also a reduced immune response due to concomitant steroid therapy.","Labarile, Nunzia; Castellana, Fabio; Sila, Annamaria; Pesole, Pasqua Letizia; Coletta, Sergio; Curlo, Margherita; Sardone, Rodolfo; Giannelli, Gianluigi; Mastronardi, Mauro",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines10071077,35891241,"Unit of Gastroenterology, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Unit of Research Methodology and Data Sciences for Population Health, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Unit of Research Methodology and Data Sciences for Population Health, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Biobank Core Facilities, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Via Turi 27, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Biobank Core Facilities, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Via Turi 27, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Unit of Research Methodology and Data Sciences for Population Health, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Scientific Direction, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit, National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS ""Saverio de Bellis"", Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, 70013 Bari, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891241,
Therapeutic Perspectives of CD26 Inhibitors in Imune-Mediated Diseases.,Jul 2022,"The enzymatic activity of CD26/DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4/DPP4) is highlighted in multiple studies to play a vital role in glucose metabolism by cleaving and inactivating the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP) and gastric inhibitory protein (GIP). A large number of studies demonstrate that CD26 also plays an integral role in the immune system, particularly in T cell activation. CD26 is extensively expressed in immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The enzymatic activity of CD26 cleaves and regulates numerous chomokines and cytokines. CD26 inhibitors have been widely used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, while it is still under investigation as a therapy for immune-mediated diseases.

Here, we present Sample-Intrinsic microbial DNA Found by Tagging and sequencing (SIFT-seq) a metagenomic sequencing assay that is robust against environmental DNA contamination introduced during sample preparation. The core idea of SIFT-seq is to tag the DNA in the sample prior to DNA isolation and library preparation with a label that can be recorded by DNA sequencing. Any contaminating DNA that is introduced in the sample after tagging can then be bioinformatically identified and removed.

Top 20 Research Studies of 2021 for Primary Care Physicians.,Jul 2022,"This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19 pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic.","Ebell, Mark H; Grad, Roland",American family physician,1532-0650,,35839363,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35839363,

Evidences suggest the respiratory illness SARS-CoV-2 has a sensitive affect on causing organ damage and other complications to the patients with autoimmune diseases (AD), posing a significant risk factor. The genetic interrelationships and molecular appearances between SARS-CoV-2 and AD are yet unknown. We carried out the transcriptomic analytical framework to delve into the SARS-CoV-2 impacts on AD progression. We analyzed both gene expression microarray and RNA-Seq datasets from SARS-CoV-2 and AD affected tissues. With neighborhood-based benchmarks and multilevel network topology, we obtained dysfunctional signaling and ontological pathways, gene disease (diseasesome) association network and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN), uncovered essential shared infection recurrence connectivities with biological insights underlying between SARS-CoV-2 and AD. We found a total of 77, 21, 9, 54 common DEGs for SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), SARS-CoV-2 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SARS-CoV-2 and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and SARS-CoV-2 and type 1 diabetes (T1D). The enclosure of these common DEGs with bimolecular networks revealed 10 hub proteins (FYN, VEGFA, CTNNB1, KDR, STAT1, B2M, CD3G, ITGAV, TGFB3). Drugs such as amlodipine besylate, vorinostat, methylprednisolone, and disulfiram have been identified as a common ground between SARS-CoV-2 and AD from drug repurposing investigation which will stimulate the optimal selection of medications in the battle against this ongoing pandemic triggered by COVID-19.","Al-Mustanjid, Md; Mahmud, S M Hasan; Akter, Farzana; Rahman, Md Shazzadur; Hossen, Md Sajid; Rahman, Md Habibur; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Informatics in medicine unlocked,2352-9148,10.1016/j.imu.2022.101003,35818398,"Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Science and Information Technology, Daffodil International University, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh.; Department of Computer Science, American International University-Bangladesh, Dhaka, 1229, Bangladesh.; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Science and Information Technology, Daffodil International University, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh.; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Faculty of Science and Information Technology, Daffodil International University, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh.; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Science and Information Technology, Daffodil International University, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University, Kushtia-7003, Bangladesh.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pabna Science & Technology University, Pabna, 6600, Bangladesh.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35818398,

Severe Ulcerative Colitis as a Complication of Mild COVID-19 Infection in a Vaccinated Patient.,Jun 2022,"Prior studies have proposed a direct correlation between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the severity of ulcerative colitis (UC). This is explained by an autoimmune response from molecular mimicry or via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. However, we present a novel case of an inverse correlation between asymptomatic COVID-19 causing severe UC. An 84-year-old male with prior infectious colitis and asymptomatic COVID-19 presented with septic shock secondary to presumed infectious colitis. Blood workup suggested inflammatory bowel disease, which was confirmed to be UC via flexible sigmoidoscopy and pathology. He was managed successfully with oral mesalamine and high-dose intravenous steroids, which were later transitioned to an oral taper. This case reflects that the intensity of the impact of COVID-19 on the gastrointestinal system can be as variable as the immune system reaction in an already labile environment such as in the elderly and malnourished patients. Therefore, in view of a lack of reports establishing a relationship between these two entities, we aim to report a case and propose an association between mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 and severe UC.","Fonseca Mora, Maria Camila; Abushahin, Ashraf; Gupta, Rohit; Winters, Harry; Khan, Gulam M",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.25783,35812630,"Department of Internal Medicine, Woodhull Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, USA.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, USA.; Department of Gastroenterology, Woodhull Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.; Department of Gastroenterology, Woodhull Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35812630,
Risks of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Evidence.,2022,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease, are a group of chronic, immune mediated conditions that are presumed to occur in genetically susceptible individuals because of a dysregulated intestinal immune response to environmental factors. IBD patients can be considered subjects with an aberrant immune response that makes them at increased risk of infections, particularly those due to opportunistic pathogens. In many cases this risk is significantly increased by the therapy they receive. Aim of this narrative review is to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with IBD. Available data indicate that patients with IBD do not have an increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that, if infected, in the majority of the cases they must not modify the therapy in place because this does not negatively affect the COVID-19 course. Only corticosteroids should be reduced or suspended due to the risk of causing severe forms. Furthermore, COVID-19 seems to modify the course of IBD mainly due to the impact on intestinal disease of the psychological factors deriving from the measures implemented to deal with the pandemic. The data relating to the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 or by COVID-19 vaccines can be considered much less definitive. It seems certain that the immune response to disease and vaccines is not substantially different from that seen in healthy subjects, with the exception of patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants who showed a reduced immune response. How much, however, this problem reduces induced protection is not known. Moreover, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on IBD course and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines has not been studied and deserves attention. Further studies capable of facing and solving unanswered questions are needed in order to adequately protect IBD patients from the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Esposito, Susanna; Caminiti, Caterina; Giordano, Rosanna; Argentiero, Alberto; Ramundo, Greta; Principi, Nicola",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2022.933774,35812420,"Pediatric Clinic, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Research and Innovation Unit, University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Department of Public Health, AUSL Parma, Parma, Italy.; Pediatric Clinic, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Pediatric Clinic, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35812420,

"Emerging role of mitochondrial DAMPs, aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and anomalous mitophagy in gut mucosal pathogenesis.",Sep 2022,"Gastroduodenal inflammation and ulcerative injuries are increasing due to expanding socio-economic stress, unhealthy food habits-lifestyle, smoking, alcoholism and usage of medicines like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In fact, gastrointestinal (GI) complications, associated with the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, further, poses a challenge to global healthcare towards safeguarding the GI tract. Emerging evidences have discretely identified mitochondrial dysfunctions as common etiological denominators in diseases. However, it is worth realizing that mitochondrial dysfunctions are not just consequences of diseases. Rather, damaged mitochondria severely aggravate the pathogenesis thereby qualifying as perpetrable factors worth of prophylactic and therapeutic targeting. Oxidative and nitrosative stress due to endogenous and exogenous stimuli triggers mitochondrial injury causing production of mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), which, in a feed-forward loop, inflicts inflammatory tissue damage. Mitochondrial structural dynamics and mitophagy are crucial quality control parameters determining the extent of mitopathology and disease outcomes. Interestingly, apart from endogenous factors, mitochondria also crosstalk and in turn get detrimentally affected by gut pathobionts colonized during luminal dysbiosis. Although mitopathology is documented in various pre-clinical/clinical studies, a comprehensive account appreciating the mitochondrial basis of GI mucosal pathogenesis is largely lacking. Here we critically discuss the molecular events impinging on mitochondria along with the interplay of mitochondria-derived factors in fueling mucosal damage. We specifically emphasize on the potential role of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, anomalous mitophagy, mitochondrial lipoxidation and ferroptosis as emerging regulators of GI mucosal pathogenesis. We finally discuss about the prospect of mitochondrial targeting for next-generation drug discovery against GI disorders.","Mazumder, Somnath; Bindu, Samik; De, Rudranil; Debsharma, Subhashis; Pramanik, Saikat; Bandyopadhyay, Uday",Life sciences,1879-0631,10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120753,35787999,"Department of Zoology, Raja Peary Mohan College, 1 Acharya Dhruba Pal Road, Uttarpara, West Bengal 712258, India.; Department of Zoology, Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University, Cooch Behar, West Bengal 736101, India.; Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Kolkata, Plot No: 36, 37 & 38, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Newtown, Kolkata, West Bengal 700135, India.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

Boosting corrects a memory B cell defect in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-vaccinated patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Jun 2022,"Immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) generate lower amounts of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after mRNA vaccination than healthy controls. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 receptor binding domain-specific (S1-RBD-specific) B lymphocytes to identify the underlying cellular defects. Patients with IBD produced fewer anti-S1-RBD antibody-secreting B cells than controls after the first mRNA vaccination and lower amounts of total and neutralizing antibodies after the second. S1-RBD-specific memory B cells were generated to the same degree in IBD and control groups and were numerically stable for 5 months. However, the memory B cells in patients with IBD had a lower S1-RBD-binding capacity than those in controls, which is indicative of a defect in antibody affinity maturation. Administration of a third shot to patients with IBD elevated serum antibodies and generated memory B cells with a normal antigen-binding capacity. These results show that patients with IBD have defects in the formation of antibody-secreting B cells and affinity-matured memory B cells that are corrected by a third vaccination.","Pape, Kathryn A; Dileepan, Thamotharampillai; Matchett, William E; Ellwood, Charles; Stresemann, Samuel; Kabage, Amanda J; Kozysa, Daria; Evert, Clayton; Matson, Michael; Lopez, Sharon; Krueger, Peter D; Graiziger, Carolyn T; Vaughn, Byron P; Shmidt, Eugenia; Rhein, Joshua; Schacker, Timothy W; Bold, Tyler D; Langlois, Ryan A; Khoruts, Alexander; Jenkins, Marc K",JCI insight,2379-3708,10.1172/jci.insight.159618,35730567,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Center for Immunology.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, and.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology.; Center for Immunology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35730567,

Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network and Tripartite Heterogeneous Networks for Microbe-Disease Prediction.,2022,"More and more studies have shown that understanding microbe-disease associations cannot only reveal the pathogenesis of diseases, but also promote the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Because traditional medical experiments are time-consuming and expensive, many computational methods have been proposed in recent years to identify potential microbe-disease associations. In this study, we propose a method based on heterogeneous network and metapath aggregated graph neural network (MAGNN) to predict microbe-disease associations, called MATHNMDA. First, we introduce microbe-drug interactions, drug-disease associations, and microbe-disease associations to construct a microbe-drug-disease heterogeneous network. Then we take the heterogeneous network as input to MAGNN. Second, for each layer of MAGNN, we carry out intra-metapath aggregation with a multi-head attention mechanism to learn the structural and semantic information embedded in the target node context, the metapath-based neighbor nodes, and the context between them, by encoding the metapath instances under the metapath definition mode. We then use inter-metapath aggregation with an attention mechanism to combine the semantic information of all different metapaths. Third, we can get the final embedding of microbe nodes and disease nodes based on the output of the last layer in the MAGNN. Finally, we predict potential microbe-disease associations by reconstructing the microbe-disease association matrix. In addition, we evaluated the performance of MATHNMDA by comparing it with that of its variants, some state-of-the-art methods, and different datasets. The results suggest that MATHNMDA is an effective prediction method. The case studies on asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) further validate the effectiveness of MATHNMDA.","Chen, Yali; Lei, Xiujuan",Frontiers in microbiology,1664-302X,10.3389/fmicb.2022.919380,35711758,"School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China.; School of Computer Science, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35711758,

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: Role of interleukin-6 and the inflammatory cascade.,May 2022,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus that represents a serious threat to human lives has emerged. There is still no definite treatment for severe cases of the disease caused by this virus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most considered treatment strategies targets the exaggerated immune regulator, and interleukin (IL)-6 is a crucial pro-inflammatory mediator. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases show an elevated level of IL-6 related to disease severity. IL-6 activity can be inhibited by the following: IL-6 itself, IL-6 signaling pathways such as Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), gp130, IL-6R, and downstream activated ILs, such as IL-17 and IL-6 cytokine. Currently, according to these studies and their results, IL-6 blockade with anti-IL-6 or its receptor antibodies such as tocilizumab in COVID-19 is beneficial in severe cases and may reduce the mortality rate. JAK-STAT inhibitors block the cytokine storm by inhibiting several crucial pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-6 and have shown various results in clinical trials. IL-6 induces IL-17 secretion, and IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes. Clinical trials of anti-IL-17 drugs are currently recruiting, and anti-gp130 antibody is preclinical. However, this agent has shown positive effects in inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials and could be tested for SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to review the role of IL-6 in the cytokine storm and studies regarding IL-6 and blockade of its inflammatory pathways in COVID-19 to determine if any of these agents are beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","Bahmani, Mohaddeseh; Chegini, Rojin; Ghanbari, Elham; Sheykhsaran, Elham; Shiri Aghbash, Parisa; Leylabadlo, Hamed Ebrahimzadeh; Moradian, Ehsan; Kazemzadeh Houjaghan, Amir Masoud; Bannazadeh Baghi, Hossein",World journal of virology,2220-3249,10.5501/wjv.v11.i3.113,35665236,"Department of Virology, Student Research Committee, Tabriz Univer-sity of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 15731, Iran.; Department of Medical Science, Metabolic Liver Disease Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan 81745-33871, Iran.; Department of Medical Science, Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah 67159-59167, Iran.; Department of Microbiology, Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 15731, Iran.; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 15731, Iran.; Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 15731, Iran.; Department of Medical Science, Medical Faculty, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 5165665931, Iran.; Department of Internal Medicine, Medical Faculty, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6559, Iran.; Department of Virology, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz 15731, Iran. hbannazadeh@tbzmed.ac.ir.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35665236,
Re-Routing Infliximab Therapy: Subcutaneous Infliximab Opens a Path Towards Greater Convenience and Clinical Benefit.,Jun 2022,"Subcutaneous infliximab recently received approval for the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in Europe, following pivotal clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Subcutaneous infliximab demonstrated an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared with intravenous infliximab: the more stable exposure and increased systemic drug concentrations mean it has been cited as a biobetter. Alongside the pharmacokinetic advantages, potential benefits for efficacy, immunogenicity, and health-related quality-of-life outcomes have been suggested with subcutaneous infliximab. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the benefits of subcutaneous over intravenous therapies became apparent: switching from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab reduced the hospital visit-related healthcare resource burden and potential viral transmission. Clinical advantages observed in pivotal trials are also being seen in the real world. Accumulating experience from four European countries (the UK, Spain, France, and Germany) in patients with rheumatic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease supports clinical trial findings that subcutaneous infliximab is well tolerated, increases serum drug concentrations, and offers maintained or improved efficacy outcomes for patients switching from intravenous infliximab. Initial evidence is emerging with subcutaneous infliximab treatment after intravenous infliximab failure. High patient satisfaction and pharmacoeconomic benefits have also been reported with subcutaneous infliximab. Treatments aligned with patient preferences for the flexibility and convenience of at-home subcutaneous administration could boost adherence and treatment outcomes. Altogether, findings suggest that switching from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab could be advantageous, and healthcare professionals should be prepared to discuss supporting data as part of shared decision making during patient consultations.","Alten, Rieke; An, Yoorim; Kim, Dong-Hyeon; Yoon, SangWook; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Clinical drug investigation,1179-1918,10.1007/s40261-022-01162-6,35657560,"Rheumatology Research Center, Schlosspark-Klinik Charité, University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Department of Gastroenterology, CHRU-Nancy, University of Lorraine, 5 Rue du Morvan, F-5400, Nancy, France. peyrinbiroulet@gmail.com.; Inserm, NGERE, University of Lorraine, F-5400, Nancy, France. peyrinbiroulet@gmail.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35657560,

Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment-Overview.,Apr 2022,"This article is an overview of guidelines for the clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of predominantly colonic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This overview describes the systematically and comprehensively multidisciplinary recommendations based on the updated principles of evidence-based literature to promote the adoption of best surgical practices and research as well as patient and specialized healthcare provider education. Colonic IBD represents idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory disorders encompassing Crohn's colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two unsolved medical subtypes of this condition, which present similarity in their clinical and histopathological characteristics. The standard state-of-the-art classification diagnostic steps are disease evaluation and assessment according to the Montreal classification to enable explicit communication with professionals. The signs and symptoms on first presentation are mainly connected with the anatomical localization and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis ""CC"" or ""UC"". This can clinically and histologically be non-definitive to interpret to establish criteria and is classified as indeterminate colitis (IC). Conservative surgical intervention varies depending on the disease phenotype and accessible avenues. The World Gastroenterology Organizations has, for this reason, recommended guidelines for clinical diagnosis and management. Surgical intervention is indicated when conservative treatment is ineffective (refractory), during intractable gastrointestinal hemorrhage, in obstructive gastrointestinal luminal stenosis (due to fibrotic scar tissue), or in the case of abscesses, peritonitis, or complicated fistula formation. The risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer is realizable in IBD patients before and after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies, aimed at the early detection of dysplasia, are recommended. During the COVID-19 pandemic, IBD patients continued to be admitted for IBD-related surgical interventions. Virtual and phone call follow-ups reinforcing the continuity of care are recommended. There is a need for special guidelines that explore solutions to the groundwork gap in terms of access limitations to IBD care in developing countries, and the irregular representation of socioeconomic stratification needs a strategic plan for how to address this serious emerging challenge in the global pandemic.","M'Koma, Amosy Ephreim","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",1648-9144,10.3390/medicina58050567,35629984,"Department of Biochemistry, Cancer Biology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Meharry Medical College School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37208-3500, USA.; Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Meharry Medical College School of Medicine, Nashville General Hospital, Nashville, TN 37208-3599, USA.; Division of General Surgery, Section of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-0260, USA.; The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), 2549 Waukegan Road, #210, Bannockburn, IL 600015, USA.; The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35629984,
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of IBD Patients.,Apr 2022,"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by limiting their access to medical services due to restrictions and the reorganization of the healthcare systems, which affects their quality of life (QoL). We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the QoL of patients with IBD. Materials and Methods: We conducted a descriptive observational study, which included 90 adult patients diagnosed with IBD. The study sample consisted of two subgroups: a retrospective-pre-pandemic group (group A) and a prospective-pandemic group (group B). Group A included 45 IBD patients who were evaluated in 2018. Group B included 45 patients with confirmed diagnosis of IBD, evaluated between June and December 2021—the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (prospective), consecutively recruited. All the patients filled in a QoL assessment questionnaire—IBDQ-32. Subsequently, the two samples were comparatively assessed. Results: The average values of the IBDQ scores were significantly lower in 2021 compared to those recorded in 2018: 145.56 vs. 128.3 (p < 0.05). We also we found significant differences between the subscores: IBDQ1 (p = 0.043), IBDQ2 (p = 0.034), IBDQ3 (p = 0.045), IBDQ4 (p = 0.025).

Impaired Humoral Immunity with Concomitant Preserved T Cell Reactivity in IBD Patients on Treatment with Infliximab 6 Month after Vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2: A Pilot Study.,Apr 2022,"Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The most important approach to prevent severe disease progression and to contain the pandemic is the use of COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate the humoral and cellular response in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on treatment with anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-α4ß7-Integrin (vedolizumab) 6 months after mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy subjects. Methods: In this prospective study, 20 IBD patients and 9 healthy controls were included 6 months after the second BNT162b2 vaccination. In addition to quantitative determination of IgG antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein subunit S1, a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization test (sVNT) was used to assess potential neutralization capacity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were measured using an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA; Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics, Lübeck, Germany). Results: S-IgG could still be detected in the majority of IBD patients 6 months after second vaccination. Compared to healthy controls, IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents showed both lower neutralizing activity in sVNT (percent inhibition of ACE2 receptor binding by RBD protein) and lower IgG-S (AU/mL) antibody levels (AB) (sVNT: 79% vs. 2%, p < 0. 001; AB: 1018 AU/mL vs. 141 AU/mL, p = 0.025). In contrast, patients on therapy with vedolizumab showed no impairment in humoral immune response (sVNT, S-IgG) compared with healthy controls. Specific T-cellular reactivity was detected in 73% of IBD patients and in 67% of healthy controls independent of immunosuppressive therapy (anti-TNF., vedolizumab) (p = 0.189). Conclusion: Six months after BNT162b2 vaccination, this study found significantly decreased antibody levels in patients under anti-TNF therapy. IBD patients under anti-TNF and vedolizumab therapy had no impairment of T-cellular reactivity compared to healthy controls at this time point. Further studies with larger collectives for confirmation should follow.","Vollenberg, Richard; Tepasse, Phil-Robin; Lorentzen, Eva; Nowacki, Tobias Max",Journal of personalized medicine,2075-4426,10.3390/jpm12050694,35629116,"Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clincial Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clincial Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Institute of Virology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clincial Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology, Marienhospital Steinfurt, 48565 Steinfurt, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35629116,
Is It Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare or Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with COVID-19?,May 2022,"Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19/multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (PIMS-TS/MIS-C) is a potentially life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.

We aimed to present the clinical characteristics, and diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties in patients with overlapping IBD and PIMS-TS/MIS-C; Methods: We reviewed medical records of children hospitalized due to overlapping IBD and PIMS-TS/MIS-C in a single pediatric hospital from December 2020 to December 2021; Results: There were four children with overlapping IBD flare and PIMS-TS/MIS-C. In three cases, IBD recognition preceded PIMS-TS/MIS-C onset and PIMS-TS/MIS-C occurred during anti-inflammatory therapy of IBD. All children presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at PIMS-TS/MIS-C onset. All patients received IVIG and ASA treatment. In three children there was a need to use steroids to resolve PIMS-TS/MIS-C symptoms. One child was vaccinated against COVID-19; Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect patients with underlying inflammatory conditions such as IBD, inducing systemic symptoms of PIMS-TS/MIS-C, and probably triggering IBD after PIMS-TS/MIS-C. The resemblance of clinical presentations is the main source of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in PIMS-TS/MIS-C in patients with underlying IBD.","Krawiec, Paulina; Opoka-Winiarska, Violetta; Pac-Kożuchowska, Elżbieta",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm11102765,35628892,"Department of Pediatrics and Gastroenterology, Medical University of Lublin, Racławickie 1, 20-059 Lublin, Poland.; Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Rheumatology, Medical University of Lublin, Racławickie 1, 20-059 Lublin, Poland.; Department of Pediatrics and Gastroenterology, Medical University of Lublin, Racławickie 1, 20-059 Lublin, Poland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35628892,
Brief and Telehealth Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Interventions for Stress in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): A Series of Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) Studies.,May 2022,"Psychological intervention targeting distress is now considered an integral component of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. However, significant barriers to access exist which necessitate the development of effective, economic, and accessible brief and remote interventions. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a therapy with demonstrated acceptability and a growing evidence base for the treatment of distress in IBD populations. The present paper trialled two brief ACT interventions via randomized multiple baseline designs. Study 1 trialled a single-session ACT intervention (delivered face-to-face and lasting approximately two hours) targeting stress and experiential avoidance, respectively.

Realigning the LIGHT signaling network to control dysregulated inflammation.,Jul 2022,"Advances in understanding the physiologic functions of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) of ligands, receptors, and signaling networks are providing deeper insight into pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. LIGHT (TNFSF14) has emerged as an important modulator of critical innate and adaptive immune responses. LIGHT and its signaling receptors, herpesvirus entry mediator (TNFRSF14), and lymphotoxin β receptor, form an immune regulatory network with two co-receptors of herpesvirus entry mediator, checkpoint inhibitor B and T lymphocyte attenuator, and CD160. Deciphering the fundamental features of this network reveals new understanding to guide therapeutic development. Accumulating evidence from infectious diseases points to the dysregulation of the LIGHT network as a disease-driving mechanism in autoimmune and inflammatory reactions in barrier organs, including coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and inflammatory bowel diseases. Recent clinical results warrant further investigation of the LIGHT regulatory network and application of target-modifying therapeutics for disease intervention.","Ware, Carl F; Croft, Michael; Neil, Garry A",The Journal of experimental medicine,1540-9538,10.1084/jem.20220236,35604387,"Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA.; Division of Immune Regulation, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA.; Avalo Therapeutics, Inc., Wayne, PA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35604387,

A literature search was conducted twice using the Medline/PubMed database. As a result, 21 papers were included in the review, and seropositivity rate was summarized by specific type of disease, transplantation, and dialysis. When different papers studied the same type of patient group, a study with a higher number of participants was selected. Most of the solid tumor patients showed a seropositivity rate of more than 80% after the second inoculation, but a low seropositivity was found in certain tumors such as breast cancer. Research in patients with certain types of hematological malignancy and autoimmune diseases has also reported low seropositivity, and this may have been affected by the immunosuppressive treatment these patients receive. Research in patients receiving dialysis or transplantation has reported lower seropositivity rates than the general population, while all patients with inflammatory bowel disease have converted to be seropositive. Meta-analysis validating these results will be needed, and studies will also be needed on methods to protect patients with reduced immunity from COVID-19.","Cho, Kyuyeon; Park, Seoyeon; Kim, Eun-Young; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Yon, Dong K; Lee, Seung Won; Kim, Min Seo; Radua, Joaquim; Elena, Dragioti; Il Shin, Jae; Smith, Lee",Journal of medical virology,1096-9071,10.1002/jmv.27828,35567325,"Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Evidence-Based and Clinical Research Laboratory, Department of Health, Social and Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.; ICREA, Pg.

COVID-19 Vaccination in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).,May 2022,"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are believed to play a key role in the suppression of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines trials. Therefore, concerns regarding vaccination efficacy and safety among those patients were raised. Overall, vaccination is well tolerated in the IBD population, and different gastroenterological societies recommend vaccinating patients with IBD at the earliest opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, very little is known about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in special IBD populations such as pregnant and breastfeeding women or pediatric patients, and further research on this matter is crucial. The available data on vaccine efficacy are promising and show high seroconversion rates in IBD patients on different immune-modifying therapies. However, patients treated with high doses of systemic corticosteroids, infliximab or infliximab and immunomodulators may have a blunted response to the vaccination. The data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness among patients with IBD are conflicting. Nevertheless, vaccine effectiveness and safety are reported to be the most common reasons for hesitancy. This review examines the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and describes vaccination willingness and the reasons for potential hesitancy among patients with IBD.","Kubas, Aleksandra; Malecka-Wojciesko, Ewa",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm11092676,35566802,"Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, Kopcinskiego 22, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, Kopcinskiego 22, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35566802,
Flavonoids as Potential Anti-Inflammatory Molecules: A Review.,May 2022,"Hydroxylated polyphenols, also called flavonoids, are richly present in vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, herbs, seeds, stems, and flowers of numerous plants. They possess numerous medicinal properties such as antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammation. Studies show that flavonoids activate antioxidant pathways that render an anti-inflammatory effect. They inhibit the secretions of enzymes such as lysozymes and β-glucuronidase and inhibit the secretion of arachidonic acid, which reduces inflammatory reactions. Flavonoids such as quercetin, genistein, apigenin, kaempferol, and epigallocatechin 3-gallate modulate the expression and activation of a cytokine such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8); regulate the gene expression of many pro-inflammatory molecules such s nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM), and E-selectins; and also inhibits inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and lipoxygenase, which are pro-inflammatory enzymes. Understanding the anti-inflammatory action of flavonoids provides better treatment options, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive pulmonary disorder, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. This review highlights the sources, biochemical activities, and role of flavonoids in enhancing human health.","Al-Khayri, Jameel M; Sahana, Gandasi Ravikumar; Nagella, Praveen; Joseph, Biljo V; Alessa, Fatima M; Al-Mssallem, Muneera Q","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1420-3049,10.3390/molecules27092901,35566252,"Department of Plant Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Food Sciences, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Life Sciences, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029, India.; Department of Life Sciences, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029, India.; Department of Life Sciences, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029, India.; Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Agriculture and Food Sciences, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Agriculture and Food Sciences, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35566252,
COVID-19 and corticosteroids: a narrative review.,Aug 2022,"It has been reported that corticosteroid therapy was effective in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and recently in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that mitigate the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia, despite a reduction of viral clearance; corticosteroids inhibit the development of cytokine storm and multi-organ damage. The risk-benefit ratio should be assessed for critical COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, corticosteroid therapy is an effective way in the management of COVID-19, it reduces the risk of complications primarily acute lung injury and the development of ARDS. Besides, corticosteroid therapy mainly dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 and associated comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","El-Saber Batiha, Gaber; Al-Gareeb, Ali I; Saad, Hebatallah M; Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M",Inflammopharmacology,1568-5608,10.1007/s10787-022-00987-z,35562628,"Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Damanhour University, Damanhour, 22511, AlBeheira, Egypt. gaberbatiha@gmail.com.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Medicine, College of Medicine, Mustansiriyiah University, Baghdad, Iraq.; Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Matrouh University, Matrouh, 51744, Matrouh, Egypt. heba.magdy@mau.edu.eg.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Medicine, College of Medicine, Mustansiriyiah University, Baghdad, Iraq.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35562628,

Favorable vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response profile in patients undergoing immune-modifying therapies.,Jun 2022,"BACKGROUNDPatients undergoing immune-modifying therapies demonstrate a reduced humoral response after COVID-19 vaccination, but we lack a proper evaluation of the effect of such therapies on vaccine-induced T cell responses.METHODSWe longitudinally characterized humoral and spike-specific T cell responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who were on antimetabolite therapy (azathioprine or methotrexate), TNF inhibitors, and/or other biologic treatment (anti-integrin or anti-p40) for up to 6 months after completing 2-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.RESULTSWe demonstrate that a spike-specific T cell response was not only induced in treated patients with IBD at levels similar to those of healthy individuals, but also sustained at higher magnitude for up to 6 months after vaccination, particularly in those treated with TNF inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, the spike-specific T cell response in these patients was mainly preserved against mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) and characterized by a Th1/IL-10 cytokine profile.CONCLUSIONDespite the humoral response defects, patients under immune-modifying therapies demonstrated a favorable profile of vaccine-induced T cell responses that might still provide a layer of COVID-19 protection.FUNDINGThis study was funded by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) Catalyst Grant (FY2021ES) and the National Research Fund Competitive Research Programme (NRF-CRP25-2020-0003).","Qui, Martin; Le Bert, Nina; Chan, Webber Pak Wo; Tan, Malcolm; Hang, Shou Kit; Hariharaputran, Smrithi; Sim, Jean Xiang Ying; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ng, Weiling; Wan, Wei Yee; Ang, Tiing Leong; Bertoletti, Antonio; Salazar, Ennaliza",The Journal of clinical investigation,1558-8238,10.1172/JCI159500,35536644,"Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Department of Infectious Disease, and.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Department of Infectious Disease, and.; Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.; Department of Microbiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Changi General Hospital, Singapore.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.; Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR; Singapore.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35536644,
Discovering Common Pathophysiological Processes between COVID-19 and Cystic Fibrosis by Differential Gene Expression Pattern Analysis.,2022,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect mammals and birds. Coronaviruses cause infections of the respiratory system in humans, which can be minor or fatal. A comparative transcriptomic analysis has been performed to establish essential profiles of the gene expression of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) linked to cystic fibrosis (CF). Transcriptomic studies have been carried out in relation to SARS-CoV-2 since a number of people have been diagnosed with CF. The recognition of differentially expressed genes demonstrated 8 concordant genes shared between the SARS-CoV-2 and CF. Extensive gene ontology analysis and the discovery of pathway enrichment demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 response to CF. The gene ontological terms and pathway enrichment mechanisms derived from this research may affect the production of successful drugs, especially for the people with the following disorder. Identification of TF-miRNA association network reveals the interconnection between TF genes and miRNAs, which may be effective to reveal the other influenced disease that occurs for SARS-CoV-2 to CF. The enrichment of pathways reveals SARS-CoV-2-associated CF mostly engaged with the type of innate immune system, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, intestinal immune network for IgA production, mineral absorption, autoimmune thyroid disease, legionellosis, viral myocarditis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), etc. The drug compound identification demonstrates that the drug targets of IMIQUIMOD and raloxifene are the most significant with the significant hub DEGs.","Hasan, Md Tanvir; Abdulrazak, Lway Faisal; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Islam, Md Rezwan; Sathi, Yeasmin Hena; Al-Zahrani, Fahad Ahmed; Ahmed, Kawsar; Bui, Francis M; Moni, Mohammad Ali",BioMed research international,2314-6141,10.1155/2022/8078259,35528173,"Department of Software Engineering, Daffodil International University (DIU), Ashulia, Savar, Dhaka 1341, Bangladesh.; Department of Computer Science, Cihan University Sulaimaniya, Sulaimaniya, 46001 Kurdistan Region, Iraq.; Preventive Dentistry Department, College of Dentistry, Jouf University, Sakaka 72345, Saudi Arabia.; Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CFTR), Saveetha Dental College, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, India.; Department of Public Health, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Software Engineering, Daffodil International University (DIU), Ashulia, Savar, Dhaka 1341, Bangladesh.; Department of Software Engineering, Daffodil International University (DIU), Ashulia, Savar, Dhaka 1341, Bangladesh.; Computer Engineering Department, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca 24381, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, 57 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, Canada S7N 5A9.; Group of Bio-photomatix, Department of Information and Communication Technology, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University (MBSTU), Santosh, Tangail 1902, Bangladesh.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, 57 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, Canada S7N 5A9.; School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD 4072, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35528173,

Association of Gut Microbiota with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and COVID-19 Severity: A Possible Outcome of the Altered Immune Response.,May 2022,"Inflammatory bowel disease could be induced by SARS-CoV-2, involved in alteration of gut microbiota during the respiratory viral infection. Presence of viral RNA in fecal samples for longer period, even after the clearance of the virus from respiratory tract, is suggestive of dysbiosis leading to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Gut microbiome (GM) plays a significant role to stimulate the modulated antiviral immune response against invading pathogens regulating the physiological homeostasis. GM profile of COVID-19 patients has revealed the drastic depletion of dominant families of commensals in the gut such as, Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae to be replaced with Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Serratia etc. Immune dysfunction of Th1-Th17 cells along gut-lung axis impairs the mucosal lining translocating the microorganisms including commensals and metabolites to other body organs like lungs, brain, kidney through circulation. These events may cause hyper inflammations associated with excessive secretion of cytokines and chemokines to form the cytokine storm causing ARDS. Gut virome could interact with microbiome and immune cells, help establishing the antiviral immune signaling, important for health maintenance/ or in disease progression. Essentially, these immunological strategies are needed to use in future prospective therapeutics to control the severity events.","Kaushal, Anju; Noor, Rashed",Current microbiology,1432-0991,10.1007/s00284-022-02877-7,35508737,", Auckland, New Zealand. anjukaushal186@hotmail.com.; Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh. rashednoor@iub.edu.bd.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35508737,

Effectiveness and Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Mar 2022,"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are important for protection from COVID-19; however, patients with immune-mediated conditions and patients taking immunosuppressive medications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), were excluded from studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. This article provides an overview of the research and recommendations currently published on vaccines against COVID-19 in adult populations with IBD, including studies evaluating effects of commonly used medications. COVID-19 vaccines are strongly recommended for patients with IBD. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and adenovirus vector vaccines are safe in patients with IBD, and reports of severe reactions or IBD flares are rare. Studies assessing antibody response, T-cell immunity, and real-world experience demonstrate positive outcomes for mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines in patients with IBD, although mRNA vaccines may have a slight advantage. Studies assessing inactive COVID-19 vaccines are still needed. Immunosuppressive therapies used in IBD, especially tumor necrosis factor antagonists, combination therapy, and corticosteroids, may reduce antibody responses and durability, but the impact on infection, hospitalizations, and death requires further evaluation. Educating patients with this evidence-based information will likely help to reduce concerns and vaccine hesitancy.","Spiera, Emily; Ungaro, Ryan C; Kornbluth, Asher",Gastroenterology & hepatology,1554-7914,,35506005,"The Henry D.

The second decade of anti-TNF-a therapy in clinical practice: new lessons and future directions in the COVID-19 era.,Sep 2022,"Since the late 1990s, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors (anti-TNFs) have revolutionized the therapy of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) affecting the gut, joints, skin and eyes. Although the therapeutic armamentarium in IMIDs is being constantly expanded, anti-TNFs remain the cornerstone of their treatment. During the second decade of their application in clinical practice, a large body of additional knowledge has accumulated regarding various aspects of anti-TNF-α therapy, whereas new indications have been added. Recent experimental studies have shown that anti-TNFs exert their beneficial effects not only by restoring aberrant TNF-mediated immune mechanisms, but also by de-activating pathogenic fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells. Real-world data on millions of patients further confirmed the remarkable efficacy of anti-TNFs. It is now clear that anti-TNFs alter the physical course of inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, leading to inhibition of local and systemic bone loss and to a decline in the number of surgeries for disease-related complications, while anti-TNFs improve morbidity and mortality, acting beneficially also on cardiovascular comorbidities. On the other hand, no new safety signals emerged, whereas anti-TNF-α safety in pregnancy and amid the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed. The use of biosimilars was associated with cost reductions making anti-TNFs more widely available. Moreover, the current implementation of the ""treat-to-target"" approach and treatment de-escalation strategies of IMIDs were based on anti-TNFs. An intensive search to discover biomarkers to optimize response to anti-TNF-α treatment is currently ongoing. Finally, selective targeting of TNF-α receptors, new forms of anti-TNFs and combinations with other agents, are being tested in clinical trials and will probably expand the spectrum of TNF-α inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for IMIDs.","Evangelatos, Gerasimos; Bamias, Giorgos; Kitas, George D; Kollias, George; Sfikakis, Petros P",Rheumatology international,1437-160X,10.1007/s00296-022-05136-x,35503130,"Joint Academic Rheumatology Program, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. gerevag@gmail.com.; First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. gerevag@gmail.com.; Gastrointestinal Unit, Third Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; Department of Rheumatology, Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, Dudley, UK.; Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; Joint Academic Rheumatology Program, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; Institute for Bioinnovation, Biomedical Sciences Research Center ""Alexander Fleming"", Vari, Greece.; Department of Physiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; Joint Academic Rheumatology Program, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35503130,

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare and psychosocial well-being of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,2022,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented disruptions to several aspects of gastroenterology healthcare services worldwide. In particular, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a sensitive population that must retain access to healthcare services to avoid potential disease exacerbation under the continuous threat of viral infection. Emerging evidence also highlights the severe impact on these patients' mental well-being, leading to a constant cycle of stress/depression and disease activity relapse. In an effort to circumvent these healthcare challenges in a newly-shaped environment, physicians implemented telemedicine consultative care programs as a novel alternative follow-up method highly favored by the patients. The situation is still far from perfect, since a large proportion of patients are lost to follow up and/or lose adherence to their medication, especially when the exact timeframe or optimal strategy for the post-COVID era remains to be defined. Cancelation of elective endoscopic procedures has led to a significant decline of new IBD diagnoses. This review summarizes the data on the global impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients' healthcare and their psychosocial status.","Theodorou-Kanakari, Anna; Gkolfakis, Paraskevas; Tziatzios, Georgios; Lazaridis, Lazaros Dimitrios; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos",Annals of gastroenterology,1108-7471,10.20524/aog.2022.0686,35479591,"Hepatogastroenterology Unit, Second Department of Internal Medicine - Propaedeutic, Research Institute and Diabetes Center, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University General Hospital, Athens, Greece (Anna Theodorou-Kanakari, Georgios Tziatzios, Lazaros Dimitrios Lazaridis, Konstantinos Triantafyllou).; Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatopancreatology, and Digestive Oncology, CUB Erasme Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium (Paraskevas Gkolfakis).; Hepatogastroenterology Unit, Second Department of Internal Medicine - Propaedeutic, Research Institute and Diabetes Center, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University General Hospital, Athens, Greece (Anna Theodorou-Kanakari, Georgios Tziatzios, Lazaros Dimitrios Lazaridis, Konstantinos Triantafyllou).; Hepatogastroenterology Unit, Second Department of Internal Medicine - Propaedeutic, Research Institute and Diabetes Center, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University General Hospital, Athens, Greece (Anna Theodorou-Kanakari, Georgios Tziatzios, Lazaros Dimitrios Lazaridis, Konstantinos Triantafyllou).; Hepatogastroenterology Unit, Second Department of Internal Medicine - Propaedeutic, Research Institute and Diabetes Center, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University General Hospital, Athens, Greece (Anna Theodorou-Kanakari, Georgios Tziatzios, Lazaros Dimitrios Lazaridis, Konstantinos Triantafyllou).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35479591,
Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Jul 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised considerable concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those treated with immunosuppressive therapies, may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, develop worse outcomes following COVID-19, and have suboptimal vaccine response compared with the general population. In this review, we summarise data on the risk of COVID-19 and associated outcomes, and latest guidance on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with IBD. Emerging evidence suggests that commonly used medications for IBD, such as corticosteroids but not biologicals, were associated with adverse outcomes to COVID-19. There has been no increased risk of de novo, or delayed, IBD diagnoses, however, an overall decrease in endoscopy procedures has led to a rise in the number of missed endoscopic-detected cancers during the pandemic. The impact of IBD medication on vaccine response has been a research priority recently. Data suggest that patients with IBD treated with antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications had attenuated humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and more rapid antibody decay, compared with non-anti-TNF-treated patients. Reassuringly, rates of breakthrough infections and hospitalisations in all patients who received vaccines, irrespective of IBD treatment, remained low. International guidelines recommend that all patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapies should receive, at any point during their treatment cycle, three primary doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with a further booster dose as soon as possible. Future research should focus on our understanding of the rate of antibody decay in biological-treated patients, which patients require additional doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the long-term risks of COVID-19 on IBD disease course and activity, and the potential risk of long COVID-19 in patients with IBD.","Lin, Simeng; Lau, Louis Hs; Chanchlani, Neil; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Ng, Siew C",Gut,1468-3288,10.1136/gutjnl-2021-326784,35477864,"Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, UK.; Exeter Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pharmacogenetics Research Group, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, UK.; Exeter Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pharmacogenetics Research Group, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, UK.; Exeter Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pharmacogenetics Research Group, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China siewchienng@cuhk.edu.hk.; Microbiota I-Center (MagIC), Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35477864,

Accelerated waning of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.,Jun 2022,"BACKGROUNDLimited information is available on the impact of immunosuppressants on COVID-19 vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID).METHODSThis observational cohort study examined the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic disease, with or without maintenance immunosuppressive therapies. Ab and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, including neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants, were determined before and after 1 and 2 vaccine doses.RESULTSWe prospectively followed 150 subjects, 26 healthy controls, 9 patients with IMID on no treatment, 44 on anti-TNF, 16 on anti-TNF with methotrexate/azathioprine (MTX/AZA), 10 on anti-IL-23, 28 on anti-IL-12/23, 9 on anti-IL-17, and 8 on MTX/AZA. Ab and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all participants, increasing from dose 1 to dose 2 and declining 3 months later, with greater attrition in patients with IMID compared with healthy controls. Ab levels and neutralization efficacy against variants of concern were substantially lower in anti-TNF-treated patients than in healthy controls and were undetectable against Omicron by 3 months after dose 2.CONCLUSIONSOur findings support the need for a third dose of the mRNA vaccine and for continued monitoring of immunity in these patient groups.FUNDINGFunded by a donation from Juan and Stefania Speck and by Canadian Institutes of Health (CIHR)/COVID-Immunity Task Force (CITF) grants VR-1 172711 and VS1-175545 (to THW and ACG), CIHR FDN-143250 (to THW), GA2-177716 (to VC, ACG, and THW), and GA1-177703 (to ACG) and the CIHR rapid response network to SARS-CoV-2 variants, CoVaRR-Net (to ACG).","Dayam, Roya M;

Differences in SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Response Dynamics Between Class-I- and Class-II-Specific T-Cell Receptors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,2022,"T-cells specifically bind antigens to induce adaptive immune responses using highly specific molecular recognition, and a diverse T-cell repertoire with expansion of antigen-specific clones can indicate robust immune responses after infection or vaccination. For patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a spectrum of chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases usually requiring immunomodulatory treatment, the T-cell response has not been well characterized. Understanding the patient factors that result in strong vaccination responses is critical to guiding vaccination schedules and identifying mechanisms of T-cell responses in IBD and other immune-mediated conditions. Here we used T-cell receptor sequencing to show that T-cell responses in an IBD cohort were influenced by demographic and immune factors, relative to a control cohort of health care workers (HCWs). Subjects were sampled at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and longitudinally afterwards; TCR Vβ gene repertoires were sequenced and analyzed for COVID-19-specific clones. We observed significant differences in the overall strength of the T-cell response by age and vaccine type. We further stratified the T-cell response into Class-I- and Class-II-specific responses, showing that Ad26.COV2.S vector vaccine induced Class-I-biased T-cell responses, whereas mRNA vaccine types led to different responses, with mRNA-1273 vaccine inducing a more Class-I-deficient T-cell response compared to BNT162b2. Finally, we showed that these T-cell patterns were consistent with antibody levels from the same patients. Our results account for the surprising success of vaccination in nominally immuno-compromised IBD patients, while suggesting that a subset of IBD patients prone to deficiencies in T-cell response may warrant enhanced booster protocols.","Xu, Alexander M; Li, Dalin; Ebinger, Joseph E; Mengesha, Emebet; Elyanow, Rebecca; Gittelman, Rachel M; Chapman, Heidi; Joung, Sandy; Botwin, Gregory J; Pozdnyakova, Valeriya; Debbas, Philip; Mujukian, Angela; Prostko, John C; Frias, Edwin C; Stewart, James L; Horizon, Arash A; Merin, Noah; Sobhani, Kimia; Figueiredo, Jane C; Cheng, Susan; Kaplan, Ian M; McGovern, Dermot P B; Merchant, Akil; Melmed, Gil Y; Braun, Jonathan",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2022.880190,35464463,"Cedars Sinai Cancer and Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; F.

Tofacitinib and newer JAK inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease-where we are and where we are going.,2022,"Inflammatory bowel diseases, comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, are chronic, immune-mediated and progressive inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Tofacitinib is the first oral small-molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor licensed and approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in moderately-to-severely active UC after intolerance, inadequate response, or loss of response to conventional treatment or biologic therapy. The pivotal OCTAVE studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for the induction and maintenance of remission in UC. A growing body of evidence from real-world data supports the positive clinical and endoscopic benefits observed with tofacitinib treatment in the OCTAVE trials. This narrative review summarizes the current literature regarding the mechanism of action of tofacitinib, data from registrational trials, emerging real-world evidence, and an overview of the most recent safety evidence. We explore evolving treatment paradigms, including the use of tofacitinib in the COVID-19 era, pregnancy and extraintestinal manifestations, as well as the emerging concept of combining tofacitinib with biological therapy.

Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Patients Treated with Biological Therapeutic Agents: A Case-Control Study.,Apr 2022,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has raised concerns in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), not only due to consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 itself but also as a possible cause of IBD relapse. The main objective of this study was to assess the role of SARS-CoV-2 in IBD clinical recurrence in a cohort of patients undergoing biological therapy. Second, we evaluated the difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels between the start and end of the follow-up period (ΔCRP) and the rate of biological therapy discontinuation. Patients with IBD positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with non-infected patients. IBD recurrence was defined as the need for intensification of current therapy. We enrolled 95 IBD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 190 non-infected patients. During follow-up, 11 of 95 (11.6%) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients experienced disease recurrence compared to 21 of 190 (11.3%) in the control group (p = 0.894).

For this, natural omega-3 sources are presented emphasizing the importance of a healthy diet for the body's homeostasis and the enzymatic processes that these fatty acids go through once inside the body. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis are revisited under the light of the gut microbiota dysbiosis approach and how those fatty acids are able to prevent and control these two pathological conditions that are responsible for the global chronic burden and functional disability and life-threatening comorbidities if not treated properly. As a matter of reflection, as we are living a pandemic crisis owing to COVID-19 infection, we present the potential of omega-3 in preventing a poor prognosis once they contribute to balancing the immune system modulation the inflammatory process.","Zorgetto-Pinheiro, Verônica Assalin; Machate, David Johane; Figueiredo, Priscila Silva; Marcelino, Gabriela; Hiane, Priscila Aiko; Pott, Arnildo; Guimarães, Rita de Cássia Avellaneda; Bogo, Danielle",Journal of medicinal food,1557-7600,10.1089/jmf.2021.0012,35438557,"Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Group of Spectroscopy and Bioinformatics Applied Biodiversity and Health (GEBABS), Graduate Program in Science of Materials, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Biotechnology and Biodiversity in the Central-West Region of Brazil, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Health and Development in the Central-West Region, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35438557,

Tocilizumab-Associated Small Bowel Perforation in a Young Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Lesson to Remember During COVID-19 Pandemic.,Mar 2022,"Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, which has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A range of side effects have been associated with tocilizumab, with gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) being described as a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that deserves considerable attention. The authors report a case of a young male patient with a history of challenging RA who encountered a lower GIP that was associated with tocilizumab therapy. The occurrence of tocilizumab-induced GIP in this reported patient had initially posed a diagnostic dilemma, as its clinical presentation mimicked other autoimmune inflammatory and infectious diseases that are commonly associated with RA. Physicians should be aware of GIPs as a serious adverse event of tocilizumab use despite being a rare phenomenon, particularly in the era of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), when this novel drug has been authorized for the management of selected patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Therefore, early recognition and timely management of GIPs would minimize potential morbidities associated with critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Saad, Eltaib; Awadelkarim, Abdalaziz; Agab, Mohamed; Babkir, Akram",Journal of medical cases,1923-4163,10.14740/jmc3902,35356392,"Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Detroit Medical Center/Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35356392,

Micronutrient Improvement of Epithelial Barrier Function in Various Disease States: A Case for Adjuvant Therapy.,Mar 2022,"The published literature makes a very strong case that a wide range of disease morbidity associates with and may in part be due to epithelial barrier leak. An equally large body of published literature substantiates that a diverse group of micronutrients can reduce barrier leak across a wide array of epithelial tissue types, stemming from both cell culture as well as animal and human tissue models. Conversely, micronutrient deficiencies can exacerbate both barrier leak and morbidity. Focusing on zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin D, this review shows that at concentrations above RDA levels but well below toxicity limits, these micronutrients can induce cell- and tissue-specific molecular-level changes in tight junctional complexes (and by other mechanisms) that reduce barrier leak. An opportunity now exists in critical care-but also medical prophylactic and therapeutic care in general-to consider implementation of select micronutrients at elevated dosages as adjuvant therapeutics in a variety of disease management. This consideration is particularly pointed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","DiGuilio, Katherine M; Rybakovsky, Elizabeth; Abdavies, Reza; Chamoun, Romy; Flounders, Colleen A; Shepley-McTaggart, Ariel; Harty, Ronald N; Mullin, James M",International journal of molecular sciences,1422-0067,10.3390/ijms23062995,35328419,"Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.; Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.; Department of Biology, Temple University, 1900 North 12th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.; Department of Medicine, Lankenau Medical Center, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.; Department of Food and Nutrition Services, Pennsylvania Hospital, 800 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.; Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3800 Spruce St., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3800 Spruce St., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Lankenau Medical Center, 100 Lancaster Avenue, Wynnewood, PA 19096, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328419,
Adrenomedullin Therapy in Moderate to Severe COVID-19.,Feb 2022,"The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still in progress, and a significant number of patients have presented with severe illness. Recently introduced vaccines, antiviral medicines, and antibody formulations can suppress COVID-19 symptoms and decrease the number of patients exhibiting severe disease. However, complete avoidance of severe COVID-19 has not been achieved, and more importantly, there are insufficient methods to treat it. Adrenomedullin (AM) is an endogenous peptide that maintains vascular tone and endothelial barrier function. The AM plasma level is markedly increased during severe inflammatory disorders, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and COVID-19, and is associated with the severity of inflammation and its prognosis. In this study, exogenous AM administration reduced inflammation and related organ damage in rodent models. The results of this study strongly suggest that AM could be an alternative therapy in severe inflammation disorders, including COVID-19. We have previously developed an AM formulation to treat inflammatory bowel disease and are currently conducting an investigator-initiated phase 2a trial for moderate to severe COVID-19 using the same formulation. This review presents the basal AM information and the most recent translational AM/COVID-19 study.","Kita, Toshihiro; Kitamura, Kazuo",Biomedicines,2227-9059,10.3390/biomedicines10030533,35327335,"Department of Project Research, Frontier Science Research Center, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.; Department of Project Research, Frontier Science Research Center, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35327335,

A systematic review on mucocutaneous presentations after COVID-19 vaccination and expert recommendations about vaccination of important immune-mediated dermatologic disorders.,Jun 2022,"With dermatologic side effects being fairly prevalent following vaccination against COVID-19, and the multitude of studies aiming to report and analyze these adverse events, the need for an extensive investigation on previous studies seemed urgent, in order to provide a thorough body of information about these post-COVID-19 immunization mucocutaneous reactions. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive electronic search was performed through the international databases including Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane, Web of science, and Google scholar on July 12, 2021, and all articles regarding mucocutaneous manifestations and considerations after COVID-19 vaccine administration were retrieved using the following keywords: COVID-19 vaccine, dermatology considerations and mucocutaneous manifestations. A total of 917 records were retrieved and a final number of 180 articles were included in data extraction. Mild, moderate, severe and potentially life-threatening adverse events have been reported following immunization with COVID vaccines, through case reports, case series, observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and further recommendations and consensus position papers regarding vaccination. In this systematic review, we categorized these results in detail into five elaborate tables, making what we believe to be an extensively informative, unprecedented set of data on this topic. Based on our findings, in the viewpoint of the pros and cons of vaccination, mucocutaneous adverse events were mostly non-significant, self-limiting reactions, and for the more uncommon moderate to severe reactions, guidelines and consensus position papers could be of great importance to provide those at higher risks and those with specific worries of flare-ups or inefficient immunization, with sufficient recommendations to safely schedule their vaccine doses, or avoid vaccination if they have the discussed contra-indications.","Seirafianpour, Farnoosh; Pourriyahi, Homa; Gholizadeh Mesgarha, Milad; Pour Mohammad, Arash; Shaka, Zoha; Goodarzi, Azadeh",Dermatologic therapy,1529-8019,10.1111/dth.15461,35316551,"Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Expert Group (SRMEG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Dermatology, Rasool Akram Medical Complex Clinical Research Development Center (RCRDC), School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35316551,

"Antibody decay, T cell immunity and breakthrough infections following two SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with infliximab and vedolizumab.",Mar 2022,"Anti tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs increase the risk of serious respiratory infection and impair protective immunity following pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Here we report SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune responses and breakthrough infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who are treated either with the anti-TNF antibody, infliximab, or with vedolizumab targeting a gut-specific anti-integrin that does not impair systemic immunity. Geometric mean [SD] anti-S RBD antibody concentrations are lower and half-lives shorter in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following two doses of BNT162b2 (566.7 U/mL [6.2] vs 4555.3 U/mL [5.4], p <0.0001; 26.8 days [95% CI 26.2 - 27.5] vs 47.6 days [45.5 - 49.8], p <0.0001); similar results are also observed with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (184.7 U/mL [5.0] vs 784.0 U/mL [3.5], p <0.0001; 35.9 days [34.9 - 36.8] vs 58.0 days [55.0 - 61.3], p value < 0.0001). One fifth of patients fail to mount a T cell response in both treatment groups. Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent (5.8% (201/3441) vs 3.9% (66/1682), p = 0.0039) in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, and the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection is predicted by peak anti-S RBD antibody concentration after two vaccine doses. Irrespective of the treatments, higher, more sustained antibody levels are observed in patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination. Our results thus suggest that adapted vaccination schedules may be required to induce immunity in at-risk, anti-TNF-treated patients.","Lin, Simeng; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Saifuddin, Aamir; Sandoval, Diana Muñoz;

Microbial metabolites: cause or consequence in gastrointestinal disease?,Jun 2022,"Systems biology studies have established that changes in gastrointestinal microbiome composition and function can adversely impact host physiology. Notable diseases synonymously associated with dysbiosis include inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, metabolic disorders, and opportunistic and recurrent pathogen infections. However, there is a scarcity of mechanistic data that advances our understanding of taxonomic correlations with pathophysiological host-microbiome interactions. Generally, to survive a hostile gut environment, microbes are highly metabolically active and produce trans-kingdom signaling molecules to interact with competing microorganisms and the host. These specialized metabolites likely play important homeostatic roles, and identifying disease-specific taxa and their effector pathways can provide better strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, as well as the discovery of innovative therapeutics. The signaling role of microbial biotransformation products such as bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, polysaccharides, and dietary tryptophan is increasingly recognized, but little is known about the identity and function of metabolites that are synthesized by microbial biosynthetic gene clusters, including ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), polyketides (PKs), PK-NRP hybrids, and terpenes. Here we consider how bioactive natural products directly encoded by the human microbiome can contribute to the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disease, cancer, autoimmune, antimicrobial-resistant bacterial and viral infections (including COVID-19). We also present strategies used to discover these compounds and the biological activities they exhibit, with consideration of therapeutic interventions that could emerge from understanding molecular causation in gut microbiome research.","Fobofou, Serge Alain; Savidge, Tor",American journal of physiology.

Dichotomous Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor in Pulmonary Barrier Function and Alveolar Fluid Clearance.,2021,"Alveolar-capillary leak is a hallmark of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially lethal complication of severe sepsis, trauma and pneumonia, including COVID-19. Apart from barrier dysfunction, ARDS is characterized by hyper-inflammation and impaired alveolar fluid clearance (AFC), which foster the development of pulmonary permeability edema and hamper gas exchange. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is an evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic cytokine, involved in host immune defense against pathogens and cancer. TNF exists in both membrane-bound and soluble form and its mainly -but not exclusively- pro-inflammatory and cytolytic actions are mediated by partially overlapping TNFR1 and TNFR2 binding sites situated at the interface between neighboring subunits in the homo-trimer. Whereas TNFR1 signaling can mediate hyper-inflammation and impaired barrier function and AFC in the lungs, ligand stimulation of TNFR2 can protect from ventilation-induced lung injury. Spatially distinct from the TNFR binding sites, TNF harbors within its structure a lectin-like domain that rather protects lung function in ARDS. The lectin-like domain of TNF -mimicked by the 17 residue TIP peptide- represents a physiological mediator of alveolar-capillary barrier protection. and increases AFC in both hydrostatic and permeability pulmonary edema animal models. The TIP peptide directly activates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) -a key mediator of fluid and blood pressure control- upon binding to its α subunit, which is also a part of the non-selective cation channel (NSC). Activity of the lectin-like domain of TNF is preserved in complexes between TNF and its soluble TNFRs and can be physiologically relevant in pneumonia. Antibody- and soluble TNFR-based therapeutic strategies show considerable success in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, but their chronic use can increase susceptibility to infection. Since the lectin-like domain of TNF does not interfere with TNF's anti-bacterial actions, while exerting protective actions in the alveolar-capillary compartments, it is currently evaluated in clinical trials in ARDS and COVID-19. A more comprehensive knowledge of the precise role of the TNFR binding sites versus the lectin-like domain of TNF in lung injury, tissue hypoxia, repair and remodeling may foster the development of novel therapeutics for ARDS.","Lucas, Rudolf; Hadizamani, Yalda; Enkhbaatar, Perenlei; Csanyi, Gabor; Caldwell, Robert W; Hundsberger, Harald; Sridhar, Supriya; Lever, Alice Ann; Hudel, Martina; Ash, Dipankar; Ushio-Fukai, Masuko; Fukai, Tohru; Chakraborty, Trinad; Verin, Alexander; Eaton, Douglas C; Romero, Maritza; Hamacher, Jürg",Frontiers in physiology,1664-042X,10.3389/fphys.2021.793251,35264975,"Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Lungen-und Atmungsstiftung Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Pneumology, Clinic for General Internal Medicine, Lindenhofspital Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, United States.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Applied Sciences, Krems, Austria.; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Institute for Medical Microbiology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, GA, United States.; Institute for Medical Microbiology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.; Vascular Biology Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.; Lungen-und Atmungsstiftung Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Pneumology, Clinic for General Internal Medicine, Lindenhofspital Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Medical Clinic V-Pneumology, Allergology, Intensive Care Medicine, and Environmental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Medical Centre of the Saarland, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.; Institute for Clinical & Experimental Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35264975,

The present and future of gastroenterology and hepatology: an international SWOT analysis (the GASTROSWOT project).,May 2022,"GASTROSWOT is a strategic analysis of the current and projected states of the different subspecialties in gastroenterology that aims to provide guidance for research, clinical, and financial planning in gastroenterology. We executed a consensus-based international strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Four general coordinators, six field coordinators, and 12 experts participated in the study. SWOTs were provided for the following fields: neurogastroenterology, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and upper gastrointestinal diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatology and biliary diseases; endoscopy; gastrointestinal oncology; and hepatology. The GASTROSWOT analysis highlights the following in the current state of the field of gastroenterology: the incidence and complexity of several gastrointestinal diseases, including malignancies, are increasing; the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient care on several levels; and with the advent of technical innovations in gastroenterology, a well trained workforce and strategic planning are required to optimise health-care utilisation. The analysis calls attention to the following in the future of gastroenterology: artificial intelligence and the use of big data will speed up discovery and smarter health-care provision in the field; the growth and diversification of gastroenterological specialties will improve specialised care for patients, but could promote fragmentation of care and health system inefficiencies; and furthermore, thoughtful planning is needed to reach an effective balance between the need for subspecialists and the value of general gastroenterology services.","de-Madaria, Enrique; Mira, José J; Carrillo, Irene; Afif, Waqqas; Ang, Daphne; Antelo, Marina; Bollipo, Steven; Castells, Antoni; Chahal, Prabhleen; Heinrich, Henriette; Law, Joanna K; van Leerdam, Monique E; Lens, Sabela; Pannala, Rahul; Park, San Hyoung; Rabiee, Atoosa; Savarino, Edoardo V; Singh, Vikesh K; Vargo, John; Charabaty, Aline; Drenth, Joost P H",The lancet.

Effect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown on Lifestyle Factors in Japanese Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,May 2022,"Objective To examine the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on lifestyle factors and psychological stress in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods A retrospective study was conducted on patients with IBD in Japan 2 months after the initiation of the first state of emergency (June 16 to August 21, 2020). A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data, and lifestyle factors and psychological stress levels before and after the state of emergency were compared. Patients Patients with IBD who were followed up regularly at Osaka City University Hospital from June 16 to August 21, 2020, were included and were classified into elderly (≥65 years old) and non-elderly groups (<65 years old). Results The study sample comprised 451 responders (241, ulcerative colitis; 210, Crohn's disease; 0, COVID-19). The sleep duration increased, whereas the exercise, working, and walking durations decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown. The proportion of patients with psychological stress due to COVID-19, those with an inability to exercise, and those staying indoors increased significantly during COVID-19 lockdown. Lifestyle factors changed more markedly in non-elderly patients, those who were more stressed due to COVID-19, those with the inability to exercise, and those staying indoors during COVID-19 lockdown. Among elderly patients, no significant changes were identified in stress-causing factors. Conclusion The COVID-19 lockdown affected lifestyle factors and psychological stress in patients with IBD, particularly non-elderly patients.

Response to Vaccines in Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: A Narrative Review.,Feb 2022,"Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, are at increased risk of infection. International guidelines recommend vaccination to limit this risk of infection, although live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated once immunosuppressive therapy has begun. Biologic therapies used to treat IMIDs target the immune system to stop chronic pathogenic process but may also attenuate the protective immune response to vaccines. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding vaccine responses in IMID patients receiving treatment with biologic therapies, with a focus on the interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitors. B cell-depleting therapies, such as rituximab, strongly impair vaccines immunogenicity, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) fusion protein abatacept are also associated with attenuated antibody responses, which are further diminished in patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants. On the other hand, integrin, IL-6, IL-12/23, IL-17, and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) inhibitors do not appear to affect the immune response to several vaccines evaluated. Importantly, treatment with biologic therapies in IMID patients is not associated with an increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or developing severe disease. However, the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on IMID patients may be reduced compared with healthy individuals. The impact of biologic therapies on the response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seems to replicate what has been described for other vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination appears to be safe and well tolerated in IMID patients. Attenuated but, in general, still protective responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the context of certain therapies warrant current recommendations for a third primary dose in IMID patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs.","Garcillán, Beatriz; Salavert, Miguel; Regueiro, José R; Díaz-Castroverde, Sabela",Vaccines,2076-393X,10.3390/vaccines10020297,35214755,"Medical Affairs Department, Janssen, 28042 Madrid, Spain.; Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, La Fe Health Research Institute, Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, 46026 Valencia, Spain.; Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and ENT, School of Medicine, Complutense University, 12 de Octubre Health Research Institute (imas12), 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Medical Affairs Department, Janssen, 28042 Madrid, Spain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35214755,
Adamantiades-Behçet disease: from clinical heterogeneity to diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Aug 2022,"Adamantiades-Behçet disease (ABD) is a systemic disease with vasculitis, characterized by recurrent oral aphthosis and ocular, cutaneous, articular, vascular, cardiopulmonary manifestations and it is mainly found in the territories of the antique ""silk road"". ABD pathogenesis remains unknown although genetic, infectious and environmental factors seem to be implicated in the development of the disease, which is considered an auto-inflammatory condition. COVID-19 infection can present some symptoms, in particular at the level of oral and pulmonary mucosa, which require a differential diagnosis with ABD. Furthermore, the immunological alterations of this disease, and the drugs used for its treatment could influence the infection by COVID-19, and its clinical evolution. Nevertheless, vaccination anti-COVID-19 is recommended in ABD patients. The most commonly used diagnostic criteria for ABD are those established in 2014 by the International Team for the Revision of the International Criteria for BD (ITR-ICBD). Furthermore, criteria for disease severity according to the Overall Damage Index of Behçet's Syndrome (BODI) have recently been proposed in order to quantify the severity of the disease as well as the evolution during follow-up. In ABD patients it is mandatory to investigate on the presence of active/latent tuberculosis, because of the common organ involvement, such as eyes and bowel. ABD has a high morbidity and low mortality, sometimes linked to the rupture of an arterial aneurysm and/or neurological complications. This article is based on a general review on ABD ranging from the history of ABD to possible causes and clinical manifestations.

2-Deoxy-d-glucose induces deglycosylation of proinflammatory cytokine receptors and strongly reduces immunological responses in mouse models of inflammation.,Apr 2022,"Anti-proinflammatory cytokine therapies against interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-1 are major advancements in treating inflammatory diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Such therapies are mainly performed by injection of antibodies against cytokines or cytokine receptors. We initially found that the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a simple monosaccharide, attenuated cellular responses to IL-6 by inhibiting N-linked glycosylation of the IL-6 receptor gp130. Aglycoforms of gp130 did not bind to IL-6 or activate downstream intracellular signals that included Janus kinases. 2-DG completely inhibited dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, a mouse model for inflammatory bowel disease, and alleviated laminarin-induced arthritis in the SKG mouse, an experimental model for human rheumatoid arthritis. These diseases have been shown to be partially dependent on IL-6. We also found that 2-DG inhibited signals for other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and interferon -γ, and accordingly, prevented death by another inflammatory disease, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shock. Furthermore, 2-DG prevented LPS shock, a model for a cytokine storm, and LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation, a model for acute respiratory distress syndrome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These results suggest that targeted therapies that inhibit cytokine receptor glycosylation are effective for treatment of various inflammatory diseases.","Uehara, Ikuno; Kajita, Mitsuko; Tanimura, Atsuko; Hida, Shigeaki; Onda, Munehiko; Naito, Zenya; Taki, Shinsuke; Tanaka, Nobuyuki",Pharmacology research & perspectives,2052-1707,10.1002/prp2.940,35212163,"Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Health Sciences, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.; Department of Pathology, Integrative Oncological Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Pathology, Integrative Oncological Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.; Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35212163,

"COVID-19: Gastrointestinal manifestations, liver injury and recommendations.",Feb 2022,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic that affected all countries with nearly 270 million patients and 5 million deaths, as of as of December, 2021. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus targets the receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is frequently found in human intestinal epithelial cells, bile duct epithelial cells, and liver cells, and all gastrointestinal system organs are affected by COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study is to review the gastrointestinal manifestations and liver damage of COVID-19 infection and investigate the severe COVID-19 infection risk in patients that have chronic gastrointestinal disease, along with current treatment guidelines. A literature search was conducted on electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochran Library, consisting of COVID-19, liver injury, gastrointestinal system findings, and treatment. Liver and intestinal involvements are the most common manifestations. Diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain are the most frequent symptoms seen in intestinal involvement. Mild hepatitis occurs with elevated levels of transaminases. Gastrointestinal involvement is associated with long hospital stay, severity of the disease, and intensive care unit necessity. Treatments and follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplant have been negatively affected during the pandemic. Patients with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, auto-immune diseases, or liver transplantation may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. Diagnostic or therapeutic procedures should be restricted with specific conditions. Telemedicine should be used in non-urgent periodic patient follow up.

Mesenteric Panniculitis and COVID-19: A Rare Association.,Jan 2022,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically involves the respiratory system, but gastrointestinal involvement is common. Further, patients with severe COVID-19 are at high risk to develop gastrointestinal complications, including bowel ischemia, ileus, and deranged liver enzymes. We present the case of a 44-year-old woman with mild COVID-19 pneumonia who was in home isolation. Ten days after the isolation, the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of generalized abdominal pain that was sharp in nature and associated with nausea and recurrent episodes of vomiting. The patient did not complain of any respiratory symptoms. Physical examination showed diffuse tenderness with no clinical signs to suggest generalized peritonitis. The laboratory parameters showed normal hematological, renal, and hepatic profiles. No elevation in the inflammatory markers was observed. The amylase level was within the normal range. Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated the presence of misty mesentery with increased density of the mesentery with fat stranding encasing the mesenteric vessels along with mesenteric adenopathy. Such radiological features suggested the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Subsequently, intravenous corticosteroid therapy was initiated and the patient exhibited significant improvement after 24 hours. The patient was discharged after nine days of hospitalization. She was followed up after one month and she had no complaints. Mesenteric panniculitis is a rare idiopathic inflammatory condition involving the mesenteric adipose tissue.

Complicated jejunal diverticulosis with intestinal perforation and obstruction: delay in hospital visit during confinement due to COVID-19.,Feb 2022,"Diverticulosis of the small bowel is a rare entity. It can cause acute, complications such as diverticulitis, perforation, intestinal bleeding and obstruction. During the pandemic, patients were reluctant to visit hospitals for fear of contracting coronavirus disease 2019. This caused the patients to wait until the extreme deterioration of many acute surgical conditions. An 83-year-old man with multiple comorbidities showed up at the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain of 7 days of evolution. The computed tomography scan revealed a large distention of the small intestine and a small inflammatory abscess. He was transferred to the operating room where a segment of the jejunum affected by multiple diverticula located on the mesenteric side of the intestine and a mesenteric abscess related to a perforated jejunal diverticulum were identified. Complicated jejunal diverticulosis is a difficult entity to diagnose, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. To avoid this, its timely diagnosis is essential.","Ponce Beti, María S; Palacios Huatuco, René M; Picco, Santiago; Capra, Alejandro E; Perussia, Daniel G; Suizer, Alejando M",Journal of surgical case reports,2042-8812,10.1093/jscr/rjac010,35169438,"Department of General Surgery, Hospital Militar Regional Córdoba, Av.

SLAMF7 engagement superactivates macrophages in acute and chronic inflammation.,Feb 2022,"Macrophages regulate protective immune responses to infectious microbes, but aberrant macrophage activation frequently drives pathological inflammation. To identify regulators of vigorous macrophage activation, we analyzed RNA-seq data from synovial macrophages and identified SLAMF7 as a receptor associated with a superactivated macrophage state in rheumatoid arthritis. We implicated IFN-γ as a key regulator of SLAMF7 expression and engaging SLAMF7 drove a strong wave of inflammatory cytokine expression. Induction of TNF-α after SLAMF7 engagement amplified inflammation through an autocrine signaling loop. We observed SLAMF7-induced gene programs not only in macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patients but also in gut macrophages from patients with active Crohn's disease and in lung macrophages from patients with severe COVID-19. This suggests a central role for SLAMF7 in macrophage superactivation with broad implications in human disease pathology.","Simmons, Daimon P; Nguyen, Hung N; Gomez-Rivas, Emma; Jeong, Yunju; Jonsson, A Helena; Chen, Antonia F; Lange, Jeffrey K; Dyer, George S; Blazar, Philip; Earp, Brandon E; Coblyn, Jonathan S; Massarotti, Elena M; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Todd, Derrick J; ,; Rao, Deepak A; Kim, Edy Y; Brenner, Michael B",Science immunology,2470-9468,10.1126/sciimmunol.abf2846,35148199,"Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148199,

A multidisciplinary approach to prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus 2019-case report.,2022,"Patients with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Currently there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 available; thus, for patients with severe ARDS, the respiratory condition needs to improve while on ECMO support. Here we present a multidisciplinary team approach to the care of a patient with COVID-related ARDS requiring three months of veno-venous (VV) ECMO which lead to recovery. A 35-year-old male was transferred to us with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection with a lactate 13.7 mmol/L and an arterial-blood gas oxygenation of 75 mmHg on maximum ventilator settings. He was placed on VV ECMO during which he developed pneumonia, bacteremia, and pneumothoraces; however, his other organ functions were preserved. During his time in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), multiple subspecialist teams participated in his care including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nutritionists, case management, and social work. The VV ECMO was weaned off after 91 days of support, after which he had a prolonged hospital course due to inflammatory bowel disease, and aspiration pneumonia. CT scan performed six weeks prior to discharge showed mild improvement in diffuse airspace opacities superimposed on extensive chronic cystic changes. He was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility 68 days after ECMO removal. He was then seen in our outpatient pulmonary clinic one month and our Post-Intensive Care Syndrome clinic three months after discharge on two liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

Alu RNA Structural Features Modulate Immune Cell Activation and A-to-I Editing of Alu RNAs Is Diminished in Human Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,2022,"Alu retrotransposons belong to the class of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Alu RNA is abundant in cells and its repetitive structure forms double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) that activate dsRNA sensors and trigger innate immune responses with significant pathological consequences. Mechanisms to prevent innate immune activation include deamination of adenosines to inosines in dsRNAs, referred to as A-to-I editing, degradation of Alu RNAs by endoribonucleases, and sequestration of Alu RNAs by RNA binding proteins. We have previously demonstrated that widespread loss of Alu RNA A-to-I editing is associated with diverse human diseases including viral (COVID-19, influenza) and autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis). Here we demonstrate loss of A-to-I editing in leukocytes is also associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Our structure-function analysis demonstrates that ability to activate innate immune responses resides in the left arm of Alu RNA, requires a 5'-PPP, RIG-I is the major Alu dsRNA sensor, and A-to-I editing disrupts both structure and function. Further, edited Alu RNAs inhibit activity of unedited Alu RNAs. Altering Alu RNA nucleotide sequence increases biological activity. Two classes of Alu RNAs exist, one class stimulates both IRF and NF-kB transcriptional activity and a second class only stimulates IRF transcriptional activity. Thus, Alu RNAs play important roles in human disease but may also have therapeutic potential.","Aune, Thomas M; Tossberg, John T; Heinrich, Rachel M; Porter, Krislyn P; Crooke, Philip S",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2022.818023,35126398,"Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126398,
[The gastrointestinal effects of COVID–19 infection during childhood and among the children affected with inflammatory bowel disease].,Feb 2022,"Összefoglaló. A SARS-CoV-2-infekció változatos kórlefolyású, a gyermekpopulációban növekvő incidenciát mutató fertőzés. Ebben a korcsoportban a felnőttekkel szemben sokkal gyakrabban tapasztalhatók gasztroenterológiai tünetek a betegség során, 18-32%-ban jelentkezik legalább egy szimptóma. Ezek nem specifikusak, gyakran megegyezhetnek a virális enteritisek, a gyulladásos bélbetegségek vagy a vakbélgyulladás tüneteivel. A gyermekkori SARS-CoV-2-infekciónak egy viszonylag ritkán megjelenő, de súlyos, akár életveszélyes szövődménye a gyermekkori sokszervi gyulladásos szindróma (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C). Ilyenkor a gastrointestinalis tünetek gyakorisága 60-100%-ra nő, sok esetben akut has benyomását keltve. A jelenlegi kutatások eredményei alapján a gyulladásos bélbeteg gyerekek az alapbetegségük miatt nincsenek nagyobb veszélynek kitéve az átlagpopulációhoz képest a COVID-19-fertőzés szempontjából. A terápiájukban alkalmazott gyógyszereik közül a nagy dózisú szteroidkezelés okoz nagyobb kockázatot a megfertőződésre, illetve ebben az esetben a súlyosabb kórlefolyásra. Az éppen remisszióban lévő gyulladásos bélbetegek fenntartó terápiájának módosítások nélküli folytatása javasolt, kiemelt figyelmet fordítva a biológiai terápiák időben történő, megszakítás nélküli alkalmazására. Törekedni kell a személyes vizitek számának csökkentésére a pandémia idején, ezek telemedicinával történő helyettesítése javasolt. A halasztható endoszkópos vizsgálatok noninvazív vizsgálómódszerekkel történő átmeneti kiváltása részesítendő előnyben a betegség aktivitásának, a terápia hatékonyságának megítélésére. A gyulladásos bélbetegségben szenvedő gyermekek COVID-19 elleni védőoltása javasolt, jelenleg minden elérhető oltóanyag alkalmazható náluk (az élő ágenst tartalmazó vakcinák ellenjavalltak). Immunmoduláns, szteroid- vagy anti-tumornekrózisfaktor (TNF)-alfa-terápia esetén az oltás lehetséges csökkent hatékonyságával kell számolni. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(6): 214-221. Summary. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is showing high variety in the disease course, with a constantly increasing incidence among the pediatric population. In this age group, at least one gastrointestinal symptom appears in 18-32% of the cases, showing a significant difference compared to the adult population. The gastrointestinal signs of COVID-19 are not specific, can mimic the symptoms of viral enteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or acute appendicitis. The multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rather rare, but serious complication of the pediatric COVID-19 disease: in these cases, the incidence of the gastrointestinal symptoms is increased up to 60-100%, often observed as acute abdomen. Based on recent researches, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are shown to have the same risk in developing COVID-19 infection compared to the normal population: in their medications, the high dose steroid treatment is proved to increase the risk of infection or to make the disease course more serious. The treatment of patients with IBD should be continued without any changes (when the disease is in remission). The use of biologics should be done with special care, with more attention keeping the schedule and the continuity. It is advised to minimise the number of personal visits during the pandemic, they should be substituted with telemedicine. The postponable endoscopic examinations should be temporarily redeemed by non-invasive methods for screening the disease activity and the efficacy of the treatment. The vaccination against COVID-19 is advised in the population with IBD. All vaccines currently available are usable in this patient group (the use of vaccines containing live agents are contraindicated). In the case of patients treated with immunmodulators, steroids or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, a possible lower efficacy can be expected after the vaccination.

Gastrointestinal and hepatic side effects of potential treatment for COVID-19 and vaccination in patients with chronic liver diseases.,Dec 2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Many clinical trials have been performed to investigate potential treatments or vaccines for this disease to reduce the high morbidity and mortality. The drugs of higher interest include umifenovir, bromhexine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroid, tocilizumab, interferon alpha or beta, ribavirin, fivapiravir, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, molnupiravir, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, and baricitinib. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and liver dysfunction are frequently seen in patients with COVID-19, which can make it difficult to differentiate disease manifestations from treatment adverse effects. GI symptoms of COVID-19 include anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Liver injury can be a result of systemic inflammation or cytokine storm, or due to the adverse drug effects in patients who have been receiving different treatments. Regular monitoring of liver function should be performed.

Review: Colon Capsule Endoscopy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Jan 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable disruption in healthcare services and has had a substantial impact on the care of patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopy services were significantly restricted, resulting in long waiting lists. There has been a growing interest in the use of capsule endoscopy in the diagnostic pathway and management of these patients. This review explores the published literature on the role of colon capsule endoscopy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as a method for mucosal assessment of extent, severity, and response to treatment. Colon capsule preparation regimens and scoring systems are reported. The studies indicate that, despite inherent limitations of minimally invasive capsule endoscopy, there is increasing evidence to support the use of the second-generation colon capsule in inflammatory bowel disease evaluation, providing an additional pathway to expedite investigation of appropriate patients especially during and after the pandemic.","Halder, Writaja; Laskaratos, Faidon-Marios; El-Mileik, Hanan; Coda, Sergio; Fox, Stevan; Banerjee, Saswata; Epstein, Owen","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2075-4418,10.3390/diagnostics12010149,35054315,"Digestive Diseases Centre, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, RM7 0AG, UK.; Wolfson Unit for Endoscopy, St Mark's Hospital, London, HA1 3UJ, UK.; Digestive Diseases Centre, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, RM7 0AG, UK.; Digestive Diseases Centre, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, RM7 0AG, UK.; Digestive Diseases Centre, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, RM7 0AG, UK.; Digestive Diseases Centre, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, RM7 0AG, UK.; Centre for Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital, London, NW3 2QY, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35054315,

This is a prospective observational study of IBD and COVID-19 included in the ENEIDA registry (53,682 from 73 centres) between March-July 2020 followed-up for 12 months. Results were compared with data of the general population (National Centre of Epidemiology and Catalonia). A total of 482 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Twenty-eight percent were infected in the work environment, and 48% were infected by intrafamilial transmission, despite having good adherence to lockdown. Thirty-five percent required hospitalization, 7.9% had severe COVID-19 and 3.7% died. Similar data were reported in the general population (hospitalisation 19.5%, ICU 2.1% and mortality 4.6%). Factors related to death and severe COVID-19 were being aged ≥ 60 years (OR 7.1, 95% CI: 1.8-27 and 4.5, 95% CI: 1.3-15.9), while having ≥2 comorbidities increased mortality (OR 3.9, 95% CI: 1.3-11.6). None of the drugs for IBD were related to severe COVID-19. Immunosuppression was definitively stopped in 1% of patients at 12 months. The prognosis of COVID-19 in IBD, even in immunosuppressed patients, is similar to that in the general population. Thus, there is no need for more strict protection measures in IBD.","Zabana, Yamile; Marín-Jiménez, Ignacio; Rodríguez-Lago, Iago; Vera, Isabel; Martín-Arranz, María Dolores; Guerra, Iván; Gisbert, Javier P;

Transmembrane serine protease 2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 anti-inflammatory receptors for COVID-19/inflammatory bowel diseases treatment.,Dec 2021,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refer to a subgroup of chronic, progressive, long-term, and relapsing inflammatory disorders. IBD may spontaneously grow in the colon, and in severe cases may result in tumor lesions such as invasive carcinoma in inflamed regions of the intestine. Recent epidemiological reports indicate that old age and underlying diseases such as IBD contribute to severity and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused serious morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has also been shown that the transmembrane serine protease 2 is an essential factor for viral activation and viral engulfment. Generally, viral entry causes a 'cytokine storm' that induces excessive generation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ.

"Perspectives on Subcutaneous Infliximab for Rheumatic Diseases and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Era.",Jun 2022,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted significant changes in patient care in rheumatology and gastroenterology, with clinical guidance issued to manage ongoing therapy while minimising the risk of nosocomial infection for patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of biologics enable patients to self-administer treatments at home; however, switching between agents may be undesirable. CT-P13 SC is the first SC formulation of infliximab that received regulatory approval and may be termed a biobetter as it offers significant clinical advantages over intravenous (IV) infliximab, including improved pharmacokinetics and a convenient mode of delivery. Potential benefits in terms of reduced immunogenicity have also been suggested. With a new SC formulation, infliximab provides an additional option for dual formulation, which enables patients to transition from IV to SC administration route without changing agent. Before COVID-19, clinical trials supported the efficacy and safety of switching from IV to SC infliximab for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and SC infliximab may have been selected on the basis of patient and HCP preferences for SC agents. During the pandemic, patients with rheumatic diseases and IBD have successfully switched from IV to SC infliximab, with some clinical benefits and high levels of patient satisfaction. As patients switched to SC therapeutics, the reduction in resource requirements for IV infusion services may have been particularly welcome given the pandemic, facilitating reorganisation and redeployment in overstretched healthcare systems, alongside pharmacoeconomic benefits and a reduction in exposure to nosocomial infection. Telemedicine and contactless healthcare have been pushed to the forefront during the pandemic, and a lasting shift towards remote patient management and community/home-based drug administration is anticipated. SC infliximab supports the implementation of this paradigm for future improvements of healthcare value delivered. The accumulation of real-world data during the pandemic supports the high level of confidence, with patients, physicians, and healthcare systems benefitting from its uptake.","Schreiber, Stefan; Ben-Horin, Shomron; Alten, Rieke; Westhovens, René; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio; Hibi, Toshifumi; Takeuchi, Ken; Magro, Fernando; An, Yoorim; Kim, Dong-Hyeon; Yoon, SangWook; Reinisch, Walter",Advances in therapy,1865-8652,10.1007/s12325-021-01990-6,34988877,"Department of Medicine I, Christian-Albrechts-University, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.; Gastroenterology Department, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology, Osteology, Schlosspark Klinik, University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Development and Regeneration, Skeletal Biology and Engineering Research Center, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Gastroenterology, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.; Inserm U1256 NGERE, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.; Center for Advanced IBD Research and Treatment, Kitasato Institute Hospital, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, IBD Center, Tsujinaka Hospital Kashiwanoha, Chiba, Japan.; Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Gastroenterology, Centro Hospitalar São João, Porto, Portugal.; MedInUP, Centre for Drug Discovery and Innovative Medicines, Porto, Portugal.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd, Incheon, Republic of Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Gürtel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria. walter.reinisch@meduniwien.ac.at.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988877,
Janus kinase-targeting therapies in rheumatology: a mechanisms-based approach.,Mar 2022,"The four Janus kinase (JAK) proteins and seven signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors mediate intracellular signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors, which are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. Development of targeted small-molecule therapies such as JAK inhibitors, which have varied selective inhibitory profiles, has enabled a paradigm shift in the treatment of diverse disorders. JAK inhibitors suppress intracellular signalling mediated by multiple cytokines involved in the pathological processes of rheumatoid arthritis and many other immune and inflammatory diseases, and therefore have the capacity to target multiple aspects of those diseases. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, JAK inhibition has potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and alopecia areata, in which stimulation of innate immunity activates adaptive immunity, leading to generation of autoreactive T cells and activation and differentiation of B cells. JAK inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, and can even be used for the COVID-19-related cytokine storm. Mechanism-based treatments targeting JAK-STAT pathways have the potential to provide positive outcomes by minimizing the use of glucocorticoids and/or non-specific immunosuppressants in the treatment of systemic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","Tanaka, Yoshiya; Luo, Yiming; O'Shea, John J; Nakayamada, Shingo",Nature reviews.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis was treated with rescue infliximab therapy, and enteric infection with an antibiotic, both with satisfactory clinical response.

Despite the very encouraging clinical trial results of these vaccines, there is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients facing various issues. After reviewing current evidence and international guidelines, the Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases developed an expert consensus statement on COVID-19 vaccination issues for Korean IBD patients. This expert consensus statement emphasizes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination be strongly recommended for IBD patients, and it is safe for IBD patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy.","Lee, Yoo Jin; Kim, Seong-Eun; Park, Yong Eun; Chang, Ji Young; Song, Hyun Joo; Kim, Duk Hwan; Yang, Young Joo; Kim, Byung Chang; Lee, Jae Gon; Yang, Hee Chan; Choi, Miyoung; Myung, Seung-Jae; ,",Intestinal research,1598-9100,10.5217/ir.2021.00098,34974674,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.; Department of Health Promotion Medicine, Ewha Womans University Seoul Hospital, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju National University College of Korea, Jeju, Korea.; Digestive Disease Center, CHA Bundang Hospital, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.; Center for Colorectal Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hwaseong, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jeonbuk National University Hospital, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.; Division of Healthcare Technology Assessment Research, National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Gastroenterology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974674,

"Metformin for Cardiovascular Protection, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Osteoporosis, Periodontitis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Neurodegeneration, Cancer, Inflammation and Senescence: What Is Next?",Dec 2021,"Diabetes is accompanied by several complications. Higher prevalence of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases has been reported among patients with diabetes. Metformin is the oldest oral antidiabetic drug and can improve coexisting complications of diabetes. Clinical trials and observational studies uncovered that metformin can remarkably prevent or alleviate cardiovascular diseases, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, cancer, periodontitis, neuronal damage and neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), tuberculosis, and COVID-19. In addition, metformin has been proposed as an antiaging agent. Numerous mechanisms were shown to be involved in the protective effects of metformin. Metformin activates the LKB1/AMPK pathway to interact with several intracellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. The drug modifies the biologic function of NF-κB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SIRT1/PGC-1α, NLRP3, ERK, P38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, Nrf2, JNK, and other major molecules in the intracellular signaling network. It also regulates the expression of noncoding RNAs. Thereby, metformin can regulate metabolism, growth, proliferation, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and senescence. Additionally, metformin modulates immune response, autophagy, mitophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis and exerts epigenetic effects. Furthermore, metformin protects against oxidative stress and genomic instability, preserves telomere length, and prevents stem cell exhaustion. In this review, the protective effects of metformin on each disease will be discussed using the results of recent meta-analyses, clinical trials, and observational studies. Thereafter, it will be meticulously explained how metformin reprograms intracellular signaling pathways and alters molecular and cellular interactions to modify the clinical presentations of several diseases.","Ala, Moein; Ala, Mahan",ACS pharmacology & translational science,2575-9108,10.1021/acsptsci.1c00167,34927008,"School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), 1416753955 Tehran, Iran.; School of Dentistry, Golestan University of Medical Sciences (GUMS), 4814565589 Golestan, Iran.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927008,

COVID-19 as a trigger of irritable bowel syndrome: A review of potential mechanisms.,Nov 2021,"In December 2019 a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started spreading from Wuhan city of Chinese Hubei province and rapidly became a global pandemic. Clinical symptoms of the disease range from paucisymptomatic disease to a much more severe disease. Typical symptoms of the initial phase include fever and cough, with possible progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are reported in a considerable number of affected individuals and may be due to the SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the peptidase angiotensin receptor 2. The intestinal homeostasis and microenvironment appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and in the enhancement of the systemic inflammatory responses. Long-term consequences of COVID-19 include respiratory disturbances and other disabling manifestations, such as fatigue and psychological impairment. To date, there is a paucity of data on the gastrointestinal sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since COVID-19 can directly or indirectly affect the gut physiology in different ways, it is plausible that functional bowel diseases may occur after the recovery because of potential pathophysiological alterations (dysbiosis, disruption of the intestinal barrier, mucosal microinflammation, post-infectious states, immune dysregulation and psychological stress). In this review we speculate that COVID-19 can trigger irritable bowel syndrome and we discuss the potential mechanisms.","Settanni, Carlo Romano; Ianiro, Gianluca; Ponziani, Francesca Romana; Bibbò, Stefano; Segal, Jonathan Philip; Cammarota, Giovanni; Gasbarrini, Antonio",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v27.i43.7433,34887641,"Unità Operativa Complessa Medicina Interna e Gastroenterologia, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

"Efficacy, Safety and Future Perspectives of JAK Inhibitors in the IBD Treatment.",Nov 2021,"Although development of biologics has importantly improved the effectiveness in inducing and maintaining remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), biologic therapies still have several limitations. Effective, low-cost drug therapy with good safety profile and compliance is therefore a substantial unmet medical need. A promising target for IBD treatment strategies are Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which are small molecules that interact with cytokines implicated in pathogenesis of IBD. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, which are able to block a single cytokine, JAK inhibitors have the potential to affect multiple cytokine-dependent immune pathways, which may improve the therapeutic response in some IBD patients. Tofacitinib, inhibiting signaling via different types of JAKs, has been already approved for ulcerative colitis, and several other small-molecule are still under investigation. However, one of the main concerns about using JAK inhibitors is the risk of thromboembolic events. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 appear to have an increased susceptibility for immunothrombosis. Therefore, thrombotic complications may become a serious limitation in the use of JAK inhibitors in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As many questions about safety and efficacy of small molecules still remain unclear, in our review we present the current data regarding approved JAK inhibitors, as well as those in clinical development for the treatment of IBD.","Dudek, Patrycja; Fabisiak, Adam; Zatorski, Hubert; Malecka-Wojciesko, Ewa; Talar-Wojnarowska, Renata",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm10235660,34884361,"Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Digestive Tract Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, 90-153 Lodz, Poland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884361,

Food Habit Associated Mycobiota Composition and Their Impact on Human Health.,2021,"Mycobiota is not only associated with healthy homeostasis in the human gut but also helps to adapt to the environment. Food habits, alcohol consumption, intake of probiotics, and contaminated food with a mycotoxin, often lead to the alteration in the mycobiota composition. Impaired immunity of the host may affect fungal symbiosis leading to mycosis. The human gut adapts to the commensalism fungi belonging to the phylum Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Diet habits such as plant-or animal-based, phytoestrogens enriched plant products, fat-rich diets also influence the colonization of certain fungal species in the mammalian gut. Food habits or mycotoxin-contaminated food or fungal peptides have an impact on bacterial-fungal interaction and human health.

Abdominal US in Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS).,Apr 2022,"Background Children with pediatric inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, present with abdominal pain among other nonspecific symptoms. Although initial imaging features of PIMS-TS have been reported, the duration of sonographic features remains unknown. Purpose To describe the abdominal US features of PIMS-TS at initial presentation and follow-up. Materials and Methods A retrospective review of children and young adults presenting with clinical features suspicious for PIMS-TS between April 2020 and June 2021 was carried out. US features were documented and reviewed at initial presentation and follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used and interobserver variability was calculated. Results Of 140 children and young adults presenting with suspected PIMS-TS, 120 had confirmed PIMS-TS (median age, 9 years; interquartile range, 7-12 years; 65 male patients) and 102 underwent abdominal US at presentation. PIMS-TS was present as a single abnormality in 109 of the 120 patients (91%) and abdominal symptoms were present in 104 of the 109 (95%). US examinations were abnormal in 86 of 102 patients (84%), with ascites being the most common abnormality in 65 (64%; 95% CI: 54, 73). Bowel wall thickening was present at US in 14 of the 102 patients (14%; 95% CI: 7, 20) and mesenteric inflammation was present in 16 (16%; 95% CI: 9, 23); all of these patients presented with abdominal symptoms. Among the patients with bowel wall thickening, the distal and terminal ileum were most involved (eight of 14 patients, 57%). Abdominal symptoms decreased to seven of 56 patients (13%) in those followed up at 6 months. Thirty-eight patients underwent follow-up US, and the presence of bowel inflammation had decreased to three of 27 patients (11%; 95% CI: -1, 23) in those followed up for less than 2 months and 0 of 17 (0%) in those followed up for more than 2 months. Conclusion Of 102 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent US at presentation, 14 (14%) had abdominal US findings of bowel inflammation and 16 (16%) had mesenteric edema. All US abnormalities resolved after 2 months. © RSNA, 2022 ","Meshaka, Riwa; Whittam, Fern C; Guessoum, Myriam; Eleti, Saigeet; Shelmerdine, Susan C; Arthurs, Owen J; McHugh, Kieran; Hiorns, Melanie P; Humphries, Paul D; Calder, Alistair D; Easty, Marina J; Gaynor, Edward P; Watson, Tom",Radiology,1527-1315,10.1148/radiol.211737,34874199,"From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).; From the Department of Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, England (R.M., F.C.W., M.G., S.E., K.M., M.P.H., P.D.H., A.D.C., M.J.E., E.P.G., T.W.); NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, London, England (S.C.S., O.J.A.); and University College London Hospital, London, England (P.D.H.).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874199,

However, extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are not uncommon, and are likely to be underreported. The present study describes a clinical case of a 64-year-old patient with COVID-19 with marked extrapulmonary manifestations in the setting of strong positive reactions with cycle threshold values of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19. He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia with wide pulse pressure, eventually requiring transvenous cardiac pacing. He later complained of lower abdominal pain associated with no bowel movements for four days. The computed tomography examination of the abdomen revealed circumferential wall thickening at the proximal ascending colon, suggestive of inflammatory changes and features of obstruction in the presence of inguinal hernia. Despite aggressive resuscitative efforts, the patient continued to deteriorate with multiorgan failure, and eventually succumbed to the disease after 6 days of hospitalization. The present case study deliberates the sharing of our clinical experience and therapeutic challenges in the management of COVID-19 with complex extrapulmonary manifestation.","Khalid, Karniza; Ab Wahab, Suhaila; Azni, Khaulah Karimah",Medicine international,2754-1304,10.3892/mi.2021.24,36698532,"Clinical Research Centre, Hospital Tuanku Fauziah, Ministry of Health Malaysia, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia.; Department of Internal Medicine (Infectious Disease), Hospital Tuanku Fauziah, Ministry of Health Malaysia, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia.; Department of Radiology, Hospital Tuanku Fauziah, Ministry of Health Malaysia, 01000 Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36698532,

"P034 State of Health Maintenance Among IBD Patients at a Tertiary Care Center in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.",Dec 2021,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affecting 6.8 million persons globally. Treatment of IBD focuses largely on immune suppression or modulation using corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, thiopurines, or biologic agents. These agents are effective but most of them pose a risk of infections, cancers, and osteoporosis. Many of these complications can be prevented by implementing vaccination, cancer screening, and bone health programs. Despite the progress in IBD care, recent data suggest that many IBD patients do not get preventative services. Previous studies have examined rates of vaccinations and other health maintenance metrics in North America and Europe where IBD patients are mainly of European and African descent. In comparison, Middle Eastern and Asian descent persons comprise the majority of the IBD population in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of United Arab Emirates (UAE), a major country in the Gulf region of the Middle East. Little is known to date about the state of IBD preventative care in this region. We sought to assess the proportion of patients with IBD that underwent recommended vaccinations, cancer screening (surveillance colonoscopy, PAP smear, annual skin examination), and bone health evaluation at Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City (SSMC), the largest tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi.","Aldhaleei, Wafa; Almessabi, Abdulqader; Wallace, Michael; Malik, Talha",The American journal of gastroenterology,1572-0241,10.14309/01.ajg.0000798736.44273.fa,37461953,"Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37461953,

Impairment of CD4+ T and Memory B Cell Responses but Normal Memory CD8+T-Cell Activation on Crohn's Disease after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Twin Case.,Oct 2021,"Vaccines to prevent the impact of SARS-CoV-2 are now available, including for patients with autoimmune diseases. However, there is no information about how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment could impact the cellular and humoral immune responses. This study evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular responses after vaccination with a two-dose schedule in a Crohn's disease patient treated with Infliximab (10 mg/kg); we included comparisons with a monozygotic twin. The results showed that the Crohn's disease's twin (twin 2) had no antibody detection and reduced activation of CD4+ T cell responses, unlike the twin without the autoimmune disease (twin 1). Twin 2 developed antigen-specific central memory CD8+ T-cells and IFNγ production after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination, similar to twin 1. These findings elucidated the role of T-cell immunity after COVID-19 immunization on IBD patients despite the lack of antibody production. Finally, our observation supports the consensus recommendation for IBD patients to receive COVID-19 vaccines.","Melgaço, Fabiana Gil; Azamor, Tamiris; Villar, Livia Melo; Ano Bom, Ana Paula Dinis; Melgaço, Juliana Gil",Viruses,1999-4915,10.3390/v13112143,34834950,"Laboratório de Cultu and s Biológicas, Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Rio de Janeiro, Duque de Caxias 25050-100, Brazil.; Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiológicos, Bio-Manguinhos, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Laboratório de Hepatites Virais, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiológicos, Bio-Manguinhos, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiológicos, Bio-Manguinhos, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34834950,
Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Where Do We Stand?,Nov 2021,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Immunosuppressive medication is the main therapeutic approach to reducing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Immunocompromised patients are more vulnerable to severe courses of illness after infection with common pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following severe pulmonal damage in a significant number of cases. The worldwide circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has led to major concerns about the management of IBD patients during the pandemic, as these patients are expected to be at greater risk of complications because of their underlying altered immunological condition and immunosuppressive therapies. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is considered the main approach in containing the pandemic. Today, several vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease course in subjects without underlying conditions in respective registration studies. Patients with underlying conditions such as IBD and/or immunosuppressive therapies were not included in the registration studies, so little is known about effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in immunocompromised IBD patients. This review provides an overview of the recent knowledge about vaccine response in IBD patients after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.","Tepasse, Phil-Robin; Vollenberg, Richard; Nowacki, Tobias Max","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2075-1729,10.3390/life11111220,34833096,"Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clinical Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clinical Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.; Department of Medicine B for Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Clinical Infectiology, University Hospital Muenster, 48149 Muenster, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34833096,

The implementation of necessary public health restrictions has restricted access to medications, procedures and surgeries throughout the pandemic, catalyzing widespread change in how IBD care is delivered. Rapid large-scale implementation of virtual care modalities has been shown to be feasible and acceptable for the majority of individuals with IBD and health care providers. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing barriers to accessing high-quality, multidisciplinary IBD care that addresses health care needs holistically. Continued implementation and evaluation of both synchronous and asynchronous eHealthcare modalities are required now and in the future in order to determine how best to incorporate these modalities into patient-centred, collaborative care models. Resources must be dedicated to studies that evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of eHealth-enhanced models of IBD care to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, while increasing quality of life for persons living with IBD.

"Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: COVID-19 Vaccines-Biology, Current Evidence and Recommendations.",Dec 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered a globally focused vaccine development program that produced multiple successful vaccines within a year. Four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved for use in Canada, using two different technologies, all of which have shown excellent efficacy in reducing the rate of symptomatic COVID-19 infection and 100% efficacy in preventing death from COVID-19. People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like many others with immune-mediated chronic diseases, were excluded from the pivotal trials of these vaccines, leading to early hesitancy by regulatory bodies to endorse administering the vaccines to these groups. However, recent data has shown that the adverse event rate to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among people with IBD is similar to the general population. Early data has further shown that people with IBD are capable of mounting a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly following a second dose, whereas the response to the first dose is blunted in those receiving anti-TNF therapy or conventional immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate). Based on these data and evidence from previous vaccine programs among people with IBD, multiple national and international expert panels have recommended that individuals with IBD receive complete vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible.","Murthy, Sanjay K; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Windsor, Joseph W; Ghia, Jean-Eric; Griffiths, Anne M; Panaccione, Remo; Seow, Cynthia H; Benchimol, Eric I; Bernstein, Charles N; Bitton, Alain; Huang, James Guoxian; Jones, Jennifer L; Lee, Kate; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Mukhtar, Mariam S; Tandon, Parul; Targownik, Laura E; Gibson, Deanna L",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwab033,34755040,"The Ottawa Hospital IBD Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Immunology & Internal Medicine section of Gastroenterology, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba and University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34755040,
Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Mental Health and Quality of Life.,Dec 2021,"There has been a dramatic rise in mental health difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While young adults have the lowest risk of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19, they have been identified as being at highest risk of detrimental mental health outcomes during the pandemic, along with women, those with lower socioeconomic status and those with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somewhat of a crisis in mental health has emerged across the general population through the evolution of the pandemic. A national Canadian survey identified a quadrupling of those experiencing pervasive elevated anxiety symptoms early in the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, and a doubling of those with pervasive elevated depressive symptoms. Independent of the pandemic, persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can face multiple challenges related to their disease, which can result in a significant psychosocial burden and psychologic distress. Anxiety and depression have been found to be more prevalent in persons with IBD. Many potential factors contribute to the increased psychologic distress and negative impacts on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with IBD. These include the fears of contracting COVID-19 or infecting other people. Many believe that IBD or its treatments predispose them to an increased risk of COVID-19 or a worse outcome if acquired. Concerns about access to health care add to mental distress. People with IBD generally report lower quality of life (QOL) compared to community controls. Psychologic interventions, in addition to adequate disease control, have been shown to improve health-related QOL. Uncertainty is another factor associated with reduced health-related QOL. Most studies suggest that persons with IBD have suffered QOL impairment during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. Uncertainties brought on by the pandemic are important contributors for some of the reduction in QOL.","Graff, Lesley A; Fowler, Sharyle; Jones, Jennifer L; Benchimol, Eric I; Bitton, Alain; Huang, James Guoxian; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Lee, Kate; Mukhtar, Mariam S; Tandon, Parul; Targownik, Laura E; Windsor, Joseph W; Bernstein, Charles N",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwab031,34755039,"Department of Clinical Health Psychology, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34755039,
Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Risk Factors and Medications.,Dec 2021,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease that results from dysregulation of the immune system and frequently requires medications that can affect the immune response to infections; therefore, it was imperative to quickly understand the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on persons living with IBD and how that risk may be increased by commonly used IBD medications. The IBD research community in Canada and beyond quickly established collaborative efforts to better understand the specific risk posed by COVID-19 on persons with IBD. We learned that IBD itself was not a risk factor for death or serious complications of COVID-19, and that most commonly used drug classes (with the notable exception of corticosteroids) do not increase the risk of COVID-19-related adverse outcomes. The risk factors for serious complications and death from COVID-19 appear to be similar to those identified in the wider population; those being advanced age, having pre-existing heart or lung disease, and smoking. We recommend that persons with IBD do not alter their course of therapy to avoid complications of COVID-19, though the indiscriminate use of corticosteroids should be avoided. Persons with IBD should follow the same public health recommendations as the general population to reduce their personal risk of acquiring COVID-19.","Targownik, Laura E; Bernstein, Charles N; Lakatos, Peter L; Murthy, Sanjay K; Benchimol, Eric I; Bitton, Alain; Huang, James Guoxian; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Jones, Jennifer L; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Lee, Kate; Mukhtar, Mariam S; Tandon, Parul; Windsor, Joseph W; Panaccione, Remo",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwab032,34755038,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; First Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.; The Ottawa Hospital IBD Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34755038,
Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Seniors With IBD.,Dec 2021,"The risk of hospitalization and death from Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) increases with age. The extreme elderly have been particularly vulnerable, with those above the age of 80 having a case-fatality rate as high as 15%. Aging of the immune system can lead to impaired inflammatory responses where eradication of an organism such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is inadequate but is exaggerated in such a way as to enhance pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Frailty and comorbidity are both more common in the elderly, and these can enhance the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Studies from Northern California and Italy suggest that elderly persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection than youths with IBD. While the specific impact of age-related comorbidity is less well established among people with IBD who acquire COVID-19, data from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD) database reported that having two or more chronic illnesses was independently associated with developing severe COVID-19 among people with IBD. Despite having exaggerated auto-inflammatory responses, people with IBD do not appear to have an overall increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 than the general population. However, whether seniors with IBD do worse once they acquire COVID-19 compared with seniors without IBD is not known. The advent of telehealth care has posed an information technology challenge for many seniors with and without IBD. Most persons with IBD have expressed satisfaction with virtual IBD health care (phone or video-based visits). While the elderly may have less robust immune responses to vaccinations, learning from experiences with other vaccination programs, especially influenza, have shown that vaccinating seniors decreases both morbidity and mortality and, in turn, healthcare resources.","Bernstein, Charles N; Singh, Harminder; Murthy, Sanjay K; Nguyen, Geoffrey C; Benchimol, Eric I; Bitton, Alain; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Huang, James Guoxian; Jones, Jennifer L; Lee, Kate; Targownik, Laura E; Windsor, Joseph W; Mukhtar, Mariam S; Tandon, Parul; Kaplan, Gilaad G",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwab025,34755037,"Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; IBD Clinical and Research Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; IBD Clinical and Research Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital IBD Centre, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Mount Sinai Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34755037,
Crohn's and Colitis Canada's 2021 Impact of COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada: Children and Expectant Mothers With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Dec 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) typically results in a mild infection, similar to those without IBD. Children and adolescents have less severe manifestations of COVID-19 compared to older people, whether or not they have IBD. However, some IBD medications (in particular, corticosteroids) are associated with more severe COVID-19. During the first year of the global pandemic, more IBD care was provided with online technology, necessitated by efforts to reduce hospital and clinic visits. Additionally, non-endoscopic monitoring of inflammation has been required due to the cancellation of non-urgent procedures, resulting in longer endoscopy wait-times. In contrast, pregnant people (with and without IBD) who contract COVID-19 are at increased risk of severe manifestations, death and preterm delivery, making them a priority for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protective measures and vaccination. Few studies have examined effect of COVID-19 on IBD-related disease activity in pregnant people with IBD. The pandemic has significantly affected the mental health and sense of well-being of children and their families, as well as pregnant people with IBD. These groups were much more likely to experience anxiety and depression compared with prior to the pandemic, even while concern has mostly abated regarding the effect of IBD medications and COVID-19 severity. Unfortunately, the availability of mental health care providers who specialize in people with IBD has not kept pace with the increasing demand.","Benchimol, Eric I; Carroll, Matthew W; Geist, Rose; Griffiths, Anne M; Huang, James Guoxian; Mack, David R; Bernstein, Charles N; Bitton, Alain; Jones, Jennifer L; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Kuenzig, M Ellen; Lee, Kate; Mukhtar, Mariam S; Murthy, Sanjay K; Tandon, Parul; Targownik, Laura E; Windsor, Joseph W; Seow, Cynthia H",Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,2515-2092,10.1093/jcag/gwab030,34755036,"SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; CHEO Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre and Department of Pediatrics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; SickKids Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Child Health Evaluative Sciences, SickKids Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Crohn's and Colitis Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.; The Ottawa Hospital IBD Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34755036,

Many individuals with IBD are immunocompromised. Consequently, the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic uniquely impacted those with IBD. Crohn's and Colitis Canada (CCC) formed the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to provide evidence-based guidance during the pandemic to individuals with IBD and their families. The Taskforce met regularly through the course of the pandemic, synthesizing available information on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD. At first, the information was extrapolated from expert consensus guidelines, but eventually, recommendations were adapted for an international registry of worldwide cases of COVID-19 in people with IBD. The task force launched a knowledge translation initiative consisting of a webinar series and online resources to communicate information directly to the IBD community. Taskforce recommendations were posted to CCC's website and included guidance such as risk stratification, management of immunosuppressant medications, physical distancing, and mental health. A weekly webinar series communicated critical information directly to the IBD community. During the pandemic, traffic to CCC's website increased with 484,755 unique views of the COVID-19 webpages and 126,187 views of the 23 webinars, including their video clips. CCC's COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce provided critical guidance to the IBD community as the pandemic emerged, the nation underwent a lockdown, the economy reopened, and the second wave ensued.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with IBD, particularly those on immunosuppressive therapies, were concerned that their health status may place them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing more severe disease course if infected with SARS-CoV-2. In response, Crohn's and Colitis Canada developed the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce in March 2020 to rapidly synthesize the evolving knowledge of COVID-19 as relevant to Canadians with IBD. The Taskforce communicated expert information directly to the Canadian IBD community through online tools and a webinar series. In order to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on the IBD community, Crohn's and Colitis Canada commissioned a policy report that was informed through a systematic literature review and synthesized across working groups along the following domains: Epidemiology, Children and Expectant Mothers with IBD, Seniors with IBD, Mental Health, Risk Factors and Medications, Vaccines, and Healthcare Delivery during the Pandemic and the Future Model of IBD Care. This report from Canadian physicians, researchers, and IBD community representatives highlights the physical, mental, and health systems impact of COVID-19 on the entire spectrum of the IBD community, including children, adolescents, adults, seniors, and pregnant people with IBD. This executive summary provides an overview of the crucial information from each of the chapters of the policy report, supplemented with additional information made available through Crohn's and Colitis Canada's webinar-based knowledge translation platform.","Ellen Kuenzig, M;

A competent immune network, systemic and mucosal is intrinsic to resilience and homeostasis of the human holobiont as the unit of evolution. In elderly, the immunosenescence could be associated with higher levels of proinflammatory mediators (such as IL-6), frialty and mortality. Proi-inflammatory state in elderly is denoted as inflammaging, characterized with low-grade (sterile) inflammation, as a physiologic response to life-long antigenic stimuli. When under control, inflammaging could be regarded as an efficient defense mechanism, oposed and regulated by anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules. Immunosensecence. The emerging concepts of ""individual immunobiography"" and ""trained immunity"" speak in favour that the immunological experience during the life would shape the ability of each individual to respond to various stimuli, strongly influencing the elements of innate and adaptive immunity, including macrophages and innate lymphoid cells. Older age is one of the main risk factors for the severe clinical picture and adverse outcome of COVID-19 infection, due to immunosenscence and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), both characterizing the immune reactioin in elderly. The senescent immune system, along with the advanced process of inflammaging is prone to react with uncontrolled activation of innate immune response that leads to cytokine release syndrome, tissue damage and adverse outcome of infection. Further research is aimed to nutritional and pharmacologic (immunomodulatory) interventions to influence the process of bioaging and immunosenscence, and to modulate the reaction of elderly to infection, including the COVID-19.","Banić, Marko; Pleško, Sanja; Urek, Marija; Babić, Žarko; Kardum, Duško",Psychiatria Danubina,0353-5053,,34718260,"Unit for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital Dubrava, Avenija Gojka Šuška 6, Zagreb, Croatia, mbanic@kbd.hr.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34718260,

Intestinal Protein Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Fatal COVID-19 Infection.,Apr 2022,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 contributes to morbidity and mortality mainly as a result of immune-pathology in the lungs. Recent data has shown multi-system involvement with widespread viral tropism. Here we present a detailed intestinal protein characterisation of SARS-Cov-2 entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ([IBD]; ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) with age- and sex-matched non-IBD controls, and in those with fatal COVID-19 infection. In our dataset, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 displayed a membrane enterocyte staining in the ileum (due to presence of brush border/microvilli) in contrast to a cytoplasmic pattern in the colon. We also showed a high ACE2/low TMPRSS2 expression pattern in the ileum with a reverse trend in the colon. In UC, colonic ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are cytoplasmic in nature, with significantly higher ACE2 staining intensity compared to non-IBD controls. In inflamed and unaffected IBD mucosa, ileal and colonic enterocyte ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions are not modified in the histologic presence of inflammation. We observed immune cells within the lamina propria that expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2, at higher frequencies in IBD when compared to non-IBD controls. These were identified as plasma cells with multiple myeloma oncogene 1/interferon regulatory factor 4 (MUM1/IRF4) expression. We further analysed the gut histology of six fatal COVID-19 cases, with no difference in colonic and ileal ACE2/TMRPSS2 staining (compared to non-IBD controls) and identified ACE2 + lamina propria plasma cells. Of interest, in this COVID-19 cohort, there was no histologic evidence gut inflammation despite known evidence of viral tropism within the enterocytes. Our data provides evidence for tissue expression of entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 including a close apposition to plasma cells - both pointing towards a role of the gut in the antecedent immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","McAllister, Milly J; Kirkwood, Kathryn; Chuah, Shaun C; Thompson, Emily J; Cartwright, Jennifer A; Russell, Clark D; Dorward, David A; Lucas, Christopher D; Ho, Gwo-Tzer",Inflammation,1573-2576,10.1007/s10753-021-01567-z,34697723,"Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Gastroenterology and Pathology Department, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road South, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Regional Infectious Diseases Unit, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road South, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Department of Pathology, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 51 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4SA, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 51 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4SA, UK.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK. gho@ed.ac.uk.; Edinburgh IBD Science Unit, Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. gho@ed.ac.uk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34697723,

Symptomology following mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.,Dec 2021,"Despite demonstrated efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), widespread hesitancy to vaccination persists. Improved knowledge regarding frequency, severity, and duration of vaccine-associated symptoms may help reduce hesitancy. In this prospective observational study, we studied 1032 healthcare workers who received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and completed post-vaccine symptom surveys both after dose 1 and after dose 2. We defined appreciable post-vaccine symptoms as those of at least moderate severity and lasting at least 2 days. We found that symptoms were more frequent following the second vaccine dose than the first (74% vs. 60%, P < 0.001), with >80% of all symptoms resolving within 2 days. The most common symptom was injection site pain, followed by fatigue and malaise. Overall, 20% of participants experienced appreciable symptoms after dose 1 and 30% after dose 2. In multivariable analyses, female sex was associated with greater odds of appreciable symptoms after both dose 1 (OR, 95% CI 1.73, 1.19-2.51) and dose 2 (1.76, 1.28-2.42). Prior COVID-19 was also associated with appreciable symptoms following dose 1, while younger age and history of hypertension were associated with appreciable symptoms after dose 2. We conclude that most post-vaccine symptoms are reportedly mild and last <2 days. Appreciable post-vaccine symptoms are associated with female sex, prior COVID-19, younger age, and hypertension. This information can aid clinicians in advising patients on the safety and expected symptomatology associated with vaccination.","Ebinger, Joseph E; Lan, Roy; Sun, Nancy; Wu, Min; Joung, Sandy; Botwin, Gregory J; Botting, Patrick; Al-Amili, Daniah; Aronow, Harriet; Beekley, James; Coleman, Bernice; Contreras, Sandra; Cozen, Wendy; Davis, Jennifer; Debbas, Philip; Diaz, Jacqueline; Driver, Matthew; Fert-Bober, Justyna; Gu, Quanquan; Heath, Mallory; Herrera, Ergueen; Hoang, Amy; Hussain, Shehnaz K; Huynh, Carissa; Kim, Linda; Kittleson, Michelle; Liu, Yunxian; Lloyd, John; Luong, Eric; Malladi, Bhavya; Merchant, Akil; Merin, Noah; Mujukian, Angela; Nguyen, Nathalie; Nguyen, Trevor-Trung; Pozdnyakova, Valeriya; Rashid, Mohamad; Raedschelders, Koen; Reckamp, Karen L; Rhoades, Kylie; Sternbach, Sarah; Vallejo, Rocío; White, Shane; Tompkins, Rose; Wong, Melissa; Arditi, Moshe; Figueiredo, Jane C; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Miles, Peggy B; Chavira, Cynthia; Shane, Rita; Sobhani, Kimia; Melmed, Gil Y; McGovern, Dermot P B; Braun, Jonathan G; Cheng, Susan; Minissian, Margo B",Preventive medicine,1096-0260,10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106860,34687733,"Department of Cardiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; F.

Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy With Bowel and Bladder Incontinence Following COVID-19 Infection.,Sep 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic with the recent demonstration of several neurological manifestations. While there are limited reports of neurologic involvement in the context of COVID-19 infection, recent evidence has established the neuroinvasive potential of the virus. A 57-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19 via a polymerase chain reaction test and treated as an outpatient with a combination of prednisone and azithromycin. Nine days after his initial diagnosis, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory failure where he required high-flow oxygen support at a maximum of 60 L/minute. Ten days after his admission to the intensive care unit, he was discharged requiring no oxygen at rest, but 2-3 L/minute with exertion. Nine days after his discharge, he was readmitted with a six-day history of bilateral lower extremity weakness, low back pain, diminished sensation, bowel and bladder incontinence, and decreased rectal sensation and tone. Evaluation for cauda equina syndrome was unremarkable; however, cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe central cervical stenosis of C3-4 and C4-5 with spinal cord flattening and intraparenchymal T2 hyperintensity. The examination was notable for muted reflexes in the bilateral lower extremities, T10 sensory level, decreased rectal tone, and ambulation with a walker. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. Treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and immunoglobulin resulted in partial motor resolution and complete resolution of his bowel and bladder incontinence within three days of treatment. In the face of this novel global pandemic, surgeons and clinicians should carefully evaluate patients presenting with neurologic deficits and ensure a thorough examination to accurately identify the appropriate etiology for a neurologic deficit.","Letchuman, Vijay; Wemhoff, Kelly M; Gandhoke, Gurpreet S",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.17896,34660094,"Neurological Surgery, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, USA.; Neurological Surgery, Saint Luke's Hospital, Kansas City, USA.; Neurological Surgery, Saint Luke's Hospital, Kansas City, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34660094,
Virus in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease: role of Toll-like receptor 7/8/3.,2021,"The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is influenced by immune system malfunction, particularly innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors. Furthermore, it is critical to investigate the extremely close association between viruses and IBD incidence. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 5, and 7 are involved in antiviral immune responses. Finding a relationship between TLR-related virus and IBD is important not only for understanding the disease pathogenesis, but also for developing effective therapies. It has been shown that influenza is expressed more severely in patients with IBD who use immune system inhibitors, and the influenza vaccine is less effective in these patients. In dendritic cells, TLR7 and TLR8 regulate the production of interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory mediators. COVID-19 causes the production of IL-6, possibly due to the induction of TLR pathways. TLR activation by SARS-CoV-2 causes inflammation and IL-1 production, which induces the production of IL-6. Understanding TLR-associated viruses' molecular mechanisms can greatly help improve the quality of life of people with IBD. Therefore, the present study reviewed the role of TLR7, 8, and 3 in inflammatory bowel disease as well as their association with viral infections and evaluated different antagonists for the treatment of IBD.","Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Jamshidi, Negar; Chaleshi, Vahid; Jamshidi, Nazanin; Sadeghi, Amir; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,2008-2258,,34659656,"Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34659656,

Acute COVID-19 gene-expression profiles show multiple etiologies of long-term sequelae.,Oct 2021,"Two years into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the post-acute sequelae of infection are compounding the global health crisis. Often debilitating, these sequelae are clinically heterogeneous and of unknown molecular etiology. Here, a transcriptome-wide investigation of this new condition was performed in a large cohort of acutely infected patients followed clinically into the post-acute period. Gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during the acute phase of infection, with both innate and adaptive immune cells involved. Plasma cells stood out as driving at least two distinct clusters of sequelae, one largely dependent on circulating antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the other antibody-independent. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were found concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking the emergence of these sequelae with the host response to the virus.","Thompson, Ryan C;

COVID-19 gastrointestinal and hepatic management is usually symptomatic except for high-risk populations such as patients with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune hepatitis, which require special attention.","Saleem, Saad; Ishtiaq, Rizwan; Inayat, Faisal; Aziz, Muhammad; Bleibel, Wissam",Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2008-5230,10.34172/mejdd.2021.236,36606012,"Department of Internal Medicine, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center, Toledo, OH, United States.; Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo, OH, United States.; Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center, Toledo, OH, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36606012,
Impact of COVID-19 on inflammatory bowel disease practice and perspectives for the future.,Sep 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); since its first description in December 2019, it has rapidly spread to a global pandemic. Specific concerns have been raised concerning patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the gut that frequently require immunosuppressive and biological therapies to control their activity. Accumulating evidence has so far demonstrated that patients with IBD are not at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. As for the general population, the identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 course among IBD patients have been established to be advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids has also been associated with an increased risk of death in IBD patients with COVID-19. Information on COVID-19 is constantly evolving, with data growing at a rapid pace. This will guarantee better knowledge and stronger evidence to help physicians in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for each patient, concurrently controlling for the risk of IBD disease under treatment and the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes and balancing the two. Moreover, the impact of the enormous number of severe respiratory patients on healthcare systems and facilities has led to an unprecedented redeployment of healthcare resources, significantly impacting the care of patients with chronic diseases. In this newly changed environment, the primary aim is to avoid harm whilst still providing adequate management. Telemedicine has been applied and is strongly encouraged for patients without the necessity of infusion therapy and whose conditions are stable. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has already revolutionized the management of patients with chronic immune-mediated diseases such as IBD. Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be present for some time. This is the reason why continuous research, rapid solutions and constantly updated guidelines are of utmost importance. The aim of the present review is, therefore, to point out what has been learned so far as well as to pinpoint the unanswered questions and perspectives for the future.","Viganò, Chiara; Mulinacci, Giacomo; Palermo, Andrea; Barisani, Donatella; Pirola, Lorena; Fichera, Maria; Invernizzi, Pietro; Massironi, Sara",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v27.i33.5520,34588749,"Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology and Center for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza 20900, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34588749,
The Impact of Human Herpesviruses in Clinical Practice of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the Era of COVID-19.,Sep 2021,"Human herpesviruses (HHVs): herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8, are known to be part of a family of DNA viruses that cause several diseases in humans. In clinical practice of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the complication of CMV enterocolitis, which is caused by CMV reactivation under disruption of intestinal barrier function, inflammation, or strong immunosuppressive therapy, is well known to affect the prognosis of disease. However, the relationship between other HHVs and IBD remains unclear. In the transplantation field, reactivation of other viruses, such as HHV-6, could cause colitis under immunosuppressed condition. Recent research revealed that combined infection of some HHVs could be a risk factor for colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis. This suggests that it would be important to clarify HHV behavior in the treatment for patients with IBD, especially in those under immunosuppressive therapies. Looking at the relationship with recently emerged novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), there are reports describe that SARS-CoV-2 might induce reactivation of HSV-1, EBV, VZV (herpes zoster), and HHV-6/7. If SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes common, vigilance against HHV reactivation may become more crucial. In this review, we discuss the impact of HHVs in clinical practice of inflammatory bowel diseases, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Hosomi, Shuhei; Nishida, Yu; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro",Microorganisms,2076-2607,10.3390/microorganisms9091870,34576764,"Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka 545-8585, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka 545-8585, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka 545-8585, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34576764,

"Risk, Course, and Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Adults with Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.",Aug 2021,"Susceptibility and disease course of COVID-19 among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are unclear and epidemiological data on the topic are still limited. There is some concern that patients with immuno-mediated diseases such as IBD, which are frequently treated with immunosuppressive therapies, may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with its related serious adverse outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic drugs, which are commonly prescribed to these patients, have been associated with higher rates of severe viral and bacterial infections including influenza and pneumonia. It is not known whether these drugs can be so harmful as to justify their interruption during COVID-19 infection or if, on the contrary, patients with IBD can benefit from them. As shown by recent reports, it cannot be excluded that drugs that suppress the immune system can block the characteristic cytokine storm of severe forms of COVID-19 and consequently reduce mortality. Another cause for concern is the up-regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors that has been noticed in these patients, which could facilitate the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this narrative review is to clarify the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD, the clinical characteristics of patients who contract the infection, and the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and immunosuppressive treatment.","Corrias, Angelica; Cortes, Gian Mario; Bardanzellu, Flaminia; Melis, Alice; Fanos, Vassilios; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2227-9067,10.3390/children8090753,34572185,"Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgical Sciences, AOU and University of Cagliari, SS 554 km 4500, 09042 Monserrato, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572185,
CytokineLink: A Cytokine Communication Map to Analyse Immune Responses-Case Studies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and COVID-19.,Aug 2021,"Intercellular communication mediated by cytokines is critical to the development of immune responses, particularly in the context of infectious and inflammatory diseases. By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine-cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from the literature and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated the literature information on cell-cytokine interactions from two systems of immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink, we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify cell types and cytokine interactions following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting important cytokine interactions that might contribute to severe illness in a subgroup of patients. Such findings have the potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies. CytokineLink is freely available for the scientific community through the NDEx platform and the project github repository.","Olbei, Marton; Thomas, John P; Hautefort, Isabelle; Treveil, Agatha; Bohar, Balazs; Madgwick, Matthew; Gul, Lejla; Csabai, Luca; Modos, Dezso; Korcsmaros, Tamas",Cells,2073-4409,10.3390/cells10092242,34571891,"Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Department of Genetics, Eotvos Lorand University, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Department of Genetics, Eotvos Lorand University, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.; Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich NR4 7UZ, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34571891,

Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases.,Nov 2021,"Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in inflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer a versatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases by repurposing DSF.","Ou, An-Te; Zhang, Jia-Xin; Fang, Yue-Fei; Wang, Rong; Tang, Xue-Ping; Zhao, Peng-Fei; Zhao, Yu-Ge; Zhang, Meng; Huang, Yong-Zhuo",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,1745-7254,10.1038/s41401-021-00770-w,34561552,"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.; Zhongshan Institute for Drug Discovery, SIMM, CAS, Zhongshan, 528437, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; Artemisinin Research Center, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 501450, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; Nanchang University College of Pharmacy, Nanchang, 330006, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; Artemisinin Research Center, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 501450, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China.; School of Chinese Materia Medica, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China.; Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.; Department of Pharmacy, Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China. yzhuang@simm.ac.cn.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China. yzhuang@simm.ac.cn.; Zhongshan Institute for Drug Discovery, SIMM, CAS, Zhongshan, 528437, China. yzhuang@simm.ac.cn.; NMPA Key Laboratory for Quality Research and Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients, Shanghai, 201203, China. yzhuang@simm.ac.cn.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34561552,

Neither inflammatory bowel disease nor immunosuppressants are associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19: an observational Dutch cohort study.,Aug 2022,"Conflicting data about inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and immunosuppressants are risk factors for severe COVID-19 confuse patients and healthcare providers. Clinical reports with longer follow-up are lacking. A retrospective search was performed for severe COVID-19 (hospital admission and/or mortality) one year after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an IBD cohort from one of the most affected Dutch regions. Cohort characteristics were explored by value-based healthcare data, including immunotherapy. COVID-19 cases were detected by ICD-10 codes and further examined for IBD determinants (including medication) and COVID-19 characteristics (intensive care admission, respiratory support, treatment, mortality). The national mortality register was consulted, ensuring detection of patients that died without admission. Results were compared with regional and national general population registries. The IBD cohort consisted of 1453 patients (51% Crohn's disease, 54% women, 39.9% using immunotherapy), including children. Biologics use increased during the study. Eight cases (0.55%) had severe COVID-19: seven were hospitalized (0.48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-1.04), and two died (0.14%, CI 0.002-0.55). Six patients had comorbidity, one used immunotherapy, and four had no medication. Both deceased patients were older than 80 years, had severe comorbidity, but used no immunotherapy.

Management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Sep 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has had an enormous impact on public health, medical systems, economies, and social conditions. The pandemic has also greatly influenced medical care systems for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Establishment of a global registry system and accumulated experiences have led to consensus for IBD management under the COVID-19 pandemic. IBD itself does not pose an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or aggravation of COVID-19, and immune-control treatments other than systemic steroids, such as biologics, are unlikely to increase this risk. The importance of suppressing disease activity has not changed since before the pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral changes and psychological states among patients have various results and differ by country or region as well as between adult and pediatric patients. In future, information-sharing tools that can widely and correctly disseminate the views of experts will be very important. Vaccination remains in its infancy, but the impact of immunoregulatory therapy on antibody titers must be investigated. Information about COVID-19 is constantly being updated, and new and accurate medical care updates are needed.

Clinical Pharmacology Aspects in Patients Treated with TNF Inhibitors During SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic.,May 2021,"In this period of global pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2, it is of paramount importance to recognize all risk factors that may increase the likelihood of infection. In addition to the risk factors known as pre-existing diseases and old age, risk factors could be drug treatments for chronic diseases, such as immunomodulating drugs that can alter immune defences and response to infectious agents. Antibodies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as adalimumab infliximab etanercept and golimumab have been used for over 20 years in severe cases of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or ankylosing spondylitis. Due to their mechanism of action they reduce inflammation and can stop the progression of the disease by inhibiting a key factor of inflammation such as TNF. In this article we want to examine the possible correlation between therapy with TNF inhibitors and the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the possible paradoxical therapeutic efficacy in patients with ongoing infection, especially in phase two and three. We express our opinion on this very complex and sensitive topic which is the subject of discussion among physicians and experts, based on current knowledge of the literature.","Ferrara, Francesco; Santilli, Priscilla; D'Aiuto, Vilma; Vitiello, Antonio",Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,2228-5881,10.34172/apb.2021.045,34513612,"Usl Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy.; Usl Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy.; Usl Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy.; Usl Umbria 1, Perugia, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34513612,

Therapeutic immunoglobulin A antibody for dysbiosis-related diseases.,Nov 2021,"Dysbiosis is alterations in the microbial composition compared with a healthy microbiota and often features a reduction in gut microbial diversity and a change in microbial taxa. Dysbiosis, especially in the gut, has also been proposed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. A body of evidence has shown that intestinal polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are important to regulate the gut microbiota as well as to exclude pathogenic bacteria or viral infection such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) at mucosal sites. Since the 1970s, trials for oral administration of therapeutic IgA or IgG have been performed mainly to treat infectious enteritis caused by pathogenic Escherichia coli or Clostridium difficile. However, few of them have been successfully developed for clinical application up to now. In addition to the protective function against intestinal pathogens, IgA is well known to modulate the gut commensal microbiota leading to symbiosis. Nevertheless, the development of therapeutic IgA drugs to treat dysbiosis is not progressing.

COVID-19 and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: effect of disease and treatment on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine responses.,Oct 2021,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases were considered to be at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19. Data collected over the past year, however, suggest that a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel diseases does not increase risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 compared with people without these diseases. Furthermore, substantial data suggest that certain medications frequently used in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, in particular cytokine inhibitors, might even lower the risk for severe COVID-19. Conversely, glucocorticoids and potentially B-cell-depleting treatments seem to worsen COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, the first data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with these diseases suggest that tolerability of vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is good, although the immune response to vaccination can be somewhat reduced in this patient group, particularly those taking methotrexate or CD20-targeted treatment.","Fagni, Filippo; Simon, David; Tascilar, Koray; Schoenau, Verena; Sticherling, Michael; Neurath, Markus F; Schett, Georg",The Lancet.

Telenutrition for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Tipping Point for Dietary Wellness.,Apr 2021,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, cause inflammation of the digestive tract. It is estimated that about three million Americans and, globally, over six million individuals, suffer from IBD. While most physicians, especially gastroenterologists, are experts in the function and pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, factors such as nutrition science education and training, bandwidth, culture, language, and the longitudinal nature of dietary care, represent some of the barriers to receiving optimal nutritional guidance. Remote dietary expert counseling, an emerging solution that has been further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, can improve IBD patients' nutritional status, avoid food triggers, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations.","Elamin, Sami; Cohen, Jonah",Crohn's & colitis 360,2631-827X,10.1093/crocol/otab017,34485904,"Hospital Medicine Unit, Department of General Internal Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Center for Advanced Endoscopy, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34485904,
Common contributing factors to COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease.,2021,"The devastating complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) result from an individual's dysfunctional immune response following the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Multiple toxic stressors and behaviors contribute to underlying immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the dysfunctional immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID-19. We have previously identified many contributing factors (CFs) (representing toxic exposure, lifestyle factors and psychosocial stressors) common to myriad chronic diseases. We hypothesized significant overlap between CFs associated with COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), because of the strong role immune dysfunction plays in each disease. A streamlined dot-product approach was used to identify potential CFs to COVID-19 and IBD. Of the fifty CFs to COVID-19 that were validated for demonstration purposes, approximately half had direct impact on COVID-19 (the CF and COVID-19 were mentioned in the same record; i.e., CF---→COVID-19), and the other half had indirect impact. The nascent character of the COVID-19 core literature (∼ one year old) did not allow sufficient time for the direct impacts of many CFs on COVID-19 to be identified. Therefore, an immune system dysfunction (ID) literature directly related to the COVID-19 core literature was used to augment the COVID-19 core literature and provide the remaining CFs that impacted COVID-19 indirectly (i.e., CF---→immune system dysfunction---→COVID-19). Approximately 13000 potential CFs for myriad diseases (obtained from government and university toxic substance lists) served as the starting point for the dot-product identification process. These phrases were intersected (dot-product) with phrases extracted from a PubMed-derived IBD core literature, a nascent COVID-19 core literature, and the COVID-19-related immune system dysfunction (ID) core literature to identify common ID/COVID-19 and IBD CFs. Approximately 3000 potential CFs common to both ID and IBD, almost 2300 potential CFs common to ID and COVID-19, and over 1900 potential CFs common to IBD and COVID-19 were identified. As proof of concept, we validated fifty of these ∼3000 overlapping ID/IBD candidate CFs with biologic plausibility. We further validated 24 of the fifty as common CFs in the IBD and nascent COVID-19 core literatures. This significant finding demonstrated that the CFs indirectly related to COVID-19 -- identified with use of the immune system dysfunction literature -- are strong candidates to emerge eventually as CFs directly related to COVID-19. As discussed in the main text, many more CFs common to all these core literatures could be identified and validated. ID and IBD share many common risk/contributing factors, including behaviors and toxic exposures that impair immune function. A key component to immune system health is removal of those factors that contribute to immune system dysfunction in the first place. This requires a paradigm shift from traditional Western medicine, which often focuses on treatment, rather than prevention.","Kostoff, Ronald Neil; Briggs, Michael Brandon; Kanduc, Darja; Shores, Darla Roye; Kovatsi, Leda; Vardavas, Alexander I; Porter, Alan L",Toxicology reports,2214-7500,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.08.007,34485092,"School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Gainesville, VA, 20155, United States.; Roscommon, MI, 48653, United States.; Dept. of Biosciences, Biotechnologies, and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari, Via Orabona 4, Bari, 70125, Italy.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Gastroenterology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21287, United States.; Laboratory of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124, Greece.; Laboratory of Toxicology & Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Greece.; R&D, Search Technology, Inc., Peachtree Corners, GA, 30092, United States.; School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34485092,

Do Gut Microbes Taste?,Jul 2021,"Gut microbiota has emerged as a major metabolically active organ with critical functions in both health and disease. The trillions of microorganisms hosted by the gastrointestinal tract are involved in numerous physiological and metabolic processes including modulation of appetite and regulation of energy in the host spanning from periphery to the brain. Indeed, bacteria and their metabolic byproducts are working in concert with the host chemosensory signaling pathways to affect both short- and long-term ingestive behavior. Sensing of nutrients and taste by specialized G protein-coupled receptor cells is important in transmitting food-related signals, optimizing nutrition as well as in prevention and treatment of several diseases, notably obesity, diabetes and associated metabolic disorders. Further, bacteria metabolites interact with specialized receptors cells expressed by gut epithelium leading to taste and appetite response changes to nutrients. This review describes recent advances on the role of gut bacteria in taste perception and functions. It further discusses how intestinal dysbiosis characteristic of several pathological conditions may alter and modulate taste preference and food consumption via changes in taste receptor expression.","Leung, Ryan; Covasa, Mihai",Nutrients,2072-6643,10.3390/nu13082581,34444741,"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA 91766, USA.; Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA 91766, USA.; Department of Health and Human Development, University of Suceava, 7200229 Suceava, Romania.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444741,

The Impact of COVID-19 in Gastroenterology and Hepatology.,Oct 2021,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an airborne infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We have reviewed current literature to describe the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology and hepatology as well as targets of future research.","Ramkissoon, Resham; Wang, Xiao Jing",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,1539-2031,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001600,34420001,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34420001,

The coronavirus that causes it can remain in the stool of some infected patients for a short period, even after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. Studies have increasingly reported the involvement of other organs, including the gastrointestinal system, in addition to the respiratory system. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease with an unknown cause. Emerging data suggest that the gas trointestinal system may be influenced by COVID-19 via the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), but data on the association between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis, are lacking. In this report, we describe a case of ulcerative colitis diagnosed in a 50-year-old male patient who presented with complaints of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain following the completion of treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

A machine learning approach identifies 5-ASA and ulcerative colitis as being linked with higher COVID-19 mortality in patients with IBD.,Aug 2021,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. IBD patient conditions and treatments, such as with immunosuppressants, may result in a higher risk of viral and bacterial infection and more severe outcomes of infections. The effect of the clinical and demographic factors on the prognosis of COVID-19 among IBD patients is still a significant area of investigation. The lack of available data on a large set of COVID-19 infected IBD patients has hindered progress. To circumvent this lack of large patient data, we present a random sampling approach to generate clinical COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient management, hospitalized and recovered, and hospitalized and deceased) on 20,000 IBD patients modeled on reported summary statistics obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD), an international database to monitor and report on outcomes of COVID-19 occurring in IBD patients. We apply machine learning approaches to perform a comprehensive analysis of the primary and secondary covariates to predict COVID-19 outcome in IBD patients. Our analysis reveals that age, medication usage and the number of comorbidities are the primary covariates, while IBD severity, smoking history, gender and IBD subtype (CD or UC) are key secondary features. In particular, elderly male patients with ulcerative colitis, several preexisting conditions, and who smoke comprise a highly vulnerable IBD population. Moreover, treatment with 5-ASAs (sulfasalazine/mesalamine) shows a high association with COVID-19/IBD mortality. Supervised machine learning that considers age, number of comorbidities and medication usage can predict COVID-19/IBD outcomes with approximately 70% accuracy. We explore the challenge of drawing demographic inferences from existing COVID-19/IBD data. Overall, there are fewer IBD case reports from US states with poor health ranking hindering these analyses. Generation of patient characteristics based on known summary statistics allows for increased power to detect IBD factors leading to variable COVID-19 outcomes. There is under-reporting of COVID-19 in IBD patients from US states with poor health ranking, underpinning the perils of using the repository to derive demographic information.","Roy, Satyaki; Sheikh, Shehzad Z; Furey, Terrence S",Scientific reports,2045-2322,10.1038/s41598-021-95919-2,34389789,"Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA.; Departments of Medicine and Genetics, Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. shehzad_sheikh@med.unc.edu.; Departments of Genetics and Biology, Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. tsfurey@email.unc.edu.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34389789,

The etiologic agent of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infects the intestinal epithelium, and can induce GI symptoms similar to the human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). An international surveillance epidemiology study (SECURE-IBD) reported that the standardized mortality ratio trends higher in IBD patients (1.5-1.8) and that mesalamine/sulfasalazine therapy correlates with poor outcome. The goal of our study was to experimentally address the relationship between mesalamine and SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and/or pathogenesis.","Alvarado, David M; Son, Juhee; Thackray, Larissa B; Diamond, Michael S; Ding, Siyuan; Ciorba, Matthew A; ,",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2692-8205,10.1101/2021.07.23.453393,34373857,"Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Divison of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Divison of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Divison of Pathology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis MO, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34373857,
Voriconazole-Induced Hepatotoxicity Resolved after Switching to Amphotericin B in Fusarium dimerum Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection.,Aug 2021,"BACKGROUND Fusarium spp. is a rare cause of opportunistic life-threatening fungal infections. It has a remarkably high resistance profile with few effective antifungal agents, mostly limited to voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by 1 of these 2 antifungal agents further complicates the management of these infections. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old woman with short bowel syndrome presented to the hospital with concerns of abdominal pain and loose stools. An abdominal CT was negative for inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, and there was no evidence of liver disease. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and required transfer to the ICU due to hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. On day 43 of her admission, the patient developed a low-grade fever, for which she underwent central-line and peripheral-blood cultures that were positive for Fusarium dimerum. The central line was removed and i.v. voriconazole started. After 3 days of treatment, the patient's liver enzymes rose abruptly. Voriconazole was discontinued and replaced with liposomal amphotericin B, and the liver enzymes improved significantly. The patient completed 14 days of therapy and was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS This is a case of F. dimerum infection followed by DILI from voriconazole treatment. Her infection was resolved after switching to liposomal amphotericin B, with improvement in liver enzymes on day 1 after discontinuing voriconazole. This observation demonstrates that altering antifungal classes may be an appropriate strategy when confronted with DILI.","Alshaya, Omar A; Saleh, Rana A; Alshehri, Shaden D",The American journal of case reports,1941-5923,10.12659/AJCR.932544,34373441,"Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Pharmaceutical Care Services, King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Medicine, King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34373441,

Administration of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients.,Oct 2021,"Since the beginning of vaccination programs against COVID-19 in different countries, several populations such as patients with specific immunological conditions have been considered as the priorities for immunization. In this regard, patients with autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive agents and anti-cancer therapies, need special attention. However, no confirmed data is presently available regarding COVID-19 vaccines in these populations due to exclusion from the conducted clinical trials. Given the probable suppression or over-activation of the immune system in such patients, reaching a consensus for their vaccination is critical, besides gathering data and conducting trials, which could probably clarify this matter in the future. In this review, besides a brief on the available COVID-19 vaccines, considerations and available knowledge about administering similar vaccines in patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatologic and dermatologic autoimmune disorders are summarized to help in decision making. As discussed, live-attenuated viruses, which should be avoided in these groups, are not employed in the present COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, the main concern regarding efficacy could be met using a potent COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, the vaccination timing for maximum efficacy could be decided according to the patient's condition, indicated medications, and the guides provided here. Post-vaccination monitoring is also advised to ensure an adequate immune response. Further studies in this area are urgently warranted.","Negahdaripour, Manica; Shafiekhani, Mojtaba; Moezzi, Seyed Mohammad Iman; Amiri, Sogand; Rasekh, Shiva; Bagheri, Ashkan; Mosaddeghi, Pouria; Vazin, Afsaneh",International immunopharmacology,1878-1705,10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108021,34352567,"Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Shiraz Transplant Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Clinical Pharmacy Department, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

Thirty-three acute inflammatory myelopathy cases (among them, seven cases had associated brain lesions) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection were reported. Demyelinating change was seen in cervical and thoracic regions (27.3% each, separately). Simultaneous involvement of both regions, cervical and thoracic, was seen in 45.4% of the patients. Most acute inflammatory myelopathy disorders reported sensory motor and bowel bladder dysfunctions. On cerebrospinal fluid analysis, pleocytosis and increased protein were reported in 56.7% and 76.7% of the patients, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was positive in five patients. On T2-weighted imaging, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and short-segment demyelinating lesions were reported in 76% and 21%, respectively. Among the patients with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, 61% reported ""moderate to significant"" improvement and 26% demonstrated ""no improvement"" in the motor function of lower limbs. Demyelinating changes in the entire spinal cord were observed in three patients. Most of the patients with acute inflammatory myelopathy (including brain lesions) were treated with methylprednisolone (81.8%) and plasma-exchange therapy (42.4%).

E-Health and remote management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Denmark in a time of need.,Aug 2021,"In Denmark, remote monitoring and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) started two decades ago with the web application Constant Care. The disease monitoring in Constant Care consists of simple disease activity questionnaires and home measurement of faecal calprotectin, a stool biomarker for inflammation. It has now been implemented in clinical practice at North Zealand University Hospital in Denmark. Digital health care solutions facilitate remote contact between patients and healthcare providers and have been shown to reduce time to remission, outpatient visits and hospital admissions, and increase adherence to medical therapy, quality of life and disease and treatment knowledge. In Australia, E-Health is an area of increasing interest, particularly given the significant distances travelled by rural patients to access specialist care. There are several foreseeable benefits to incorporating E-Health/remote monitoring into Australian IBD management, including reduced burdens of time and cost on rural patients, and more efficient management of well outpatients, thereby increasing clinic availability for acutely unwell patients. The significant portion of IBD patients managed in private practice in Australia, and the infrastructure within private practice that is well suited to implementation of E-Health makes Australia a viable setting for an E-Health IBD management model like Denmark's Constant Care model. One pilot study is currently underway investigating the feasibility of rapid and remote IBD monitoring and E-Health in an Australian IBD population.

"The Influence of Corticosteroids, Immunosuppressants and Biologics on Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Psoriasis and Rheumatic Diseases in the Era of COVID-19: A Review of Current Evidence.",2021,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis or other rheumatic diseases treated with corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biologics might face additional risk during COVID-19 epidemic due to their immunocompromised status. However, there was still no unanimous opinion on the use of these therapy during COVID-19 epidemic. Current studies suggested that systemic corticosteroids might increase the risk of hospitalization, as well as risks of ventilation, ICU, and death among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Anti-TNF agent was associated with lower rate of hospitalization, as well as lower risks of ventilation, ICU, and death. No significant changes in rates of hospitalization, ventilation, ICU and mortality were observed in patients treated with immunomodulators or biologics apart from anti-TNF agents. The underlying mechanism of these results might be related to pathway of antiviral immune response and cytokine storm induced by SARS-COV-2 infection.

Twelve Months with COVID-19: What Gastroenterologists Need to Know.,Jul 2022,"Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the latest global pandemic. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and, apart from respiratory symptoms, patients often present with gastrointestinal symptoms and liver involvement. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS), in this review, we report a practical up-to-date reference for the physician in their clinical practice with patients affected by chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, chronic liver disease) at the time of COVID-19. First, we summarised data on the origin and pathogenetic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Then, we performed a literature search up to December 2020 examining clinical manifestations of GI involvement. Next, we illustrated and summarised the most recent guidelines on how to adhere to GI procedures (endoscopy, liver biopsy, faecal transplantation), maintaining social distance and how to deal with immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, we focussed on some special conditions such as faecal-oral transmission and gut microbiota. The rapid accumulation of information relating to this condition makes it particularly essential to revise the literature to take account of the most recent publications for medical consultation and patient care.","Concas, Giulia; Barone, Michele; Francavilla, Ruggiero; Cristofori, Fernanda; Dargenio, Vanessa Nadia; Giorgio, Rossella; Dargenio, Costantino; Fanos, Vassilios; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta",Digestive diseases and sciences,1573-2568,10.1007/s10620-021-07158-0,34333726,"School of Paediatrics, University of Cagliari, 09124, Cagliari, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, University Hospital ""Policlinico"", Piazza G.

"Vitamin D, infections and immunity.",Apr 2022,"Vitamin D, best known for its role in skeletal health, has emerged as a key regulator of innate immune responses to microbial threat. In immune cells such as macrophages, expression of CYP27B1, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase, is induced by immune-specific inputs, leading to local production of hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) at sites of infection, which in turn directly induces the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. Vitamin D signaling is active upstream and downstream of pattern recognition receptors, which promote front-line innate immune responses. Moreover, 1,25D stimulates autophagy, which has emerged as a mechanism critical for control of intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis. Strong laboratory and epidemiological evidence links vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of conditions such as dental caries, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases arising from dysregulation of innate immune handling intestinal flora. 1,25D is also active in signaling cascades that promote antiviral innate immunity; 1,25D-induced expression of the antimicrobial peptide CAMP/LL37, originally characterized for its antibacterial properties, is a key component of antiviral responses. Poor vitamin D status is associated with greater susceptibility to viral infections, including those of the respiratory tract. Although the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has been alleviated in some areas by the arrival of vaccines, it remains important to identify therapeutic interventions that reduce disease severity and mortality, and accelerate recovery. This review outlines of our current knowledge of the mechanisms of action of vitamin D signaling in the innate immune system. It also provides an assessment of the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases, including an up-to-date analysis of the putative benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Ismailova, Aiten; White, John H",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,1573-2606,10.1007/s11154-021-09679-5,34322844,"Departments of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Qc, Canada.; Departments of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Qc, Canada. john.white@mcgill.ca.; Departments of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Qc, Canada. john.white@mcgill.ca.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34322844,
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflammatory bowel disease patients: A review of the current evidence.,Jul 2021,"Since the initial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China in December 2019, the infection has now become the biggest medical issue of modern medicine. Two major contributors that amplified the impact of the disease and subsequently increased the burden on health care systems were high mortality among patients with multiple co-morbidities and overcapacity of intensive care units. Within the gastroenterology-related community, particular concern was raised with respect to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as those patients are prone to opportunistic infections mainly owing to their immunosuppressive-based therapies. Hence, we sought to summarize current knowledge regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with IBD. Overall, it seems that IBD is not a comorbidity that poses an increased risk for COVID-19 acquisition, except in patients treated with 5-aminosalicylates. Furthermore, outcomes of the infected patients are largely dependent on therapeutic modality by which they are treated, as some worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 infection, whereas others seem to dampen the detrimental effects of COVID-19. Finally, we discussed the present and the future impact of COVID-19 pandemic and concomitantly increased health care burden on IBD-management.","Kumric, Marko; Ticinovic Kurir, Tina; Martinovic, Dinko; Zivkovic, Piero Marin; Bozic, Josko",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v27.i25.3748,34321841,"Department of Pathophysiology, University of Split School of Medicine, Split 21000, Croatia.; Department of Pathophysiology, University of Split School of Medicine, Split 21000, Croatia.; Department of Pathophysiology, University of Split School of Medicine, Split 21000, Croatia.; Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Split, Split 21000, Croatia.; Department of Pathophysiology, University of Split School of Medicine, Split 21000, Croatia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34321841,

"Correct use of telemedicine in gastroenterology, hepatology, and endoscopy during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: Recommendations from the Italian association of hospital gastroenterologists and endoscopists (AIGO).",Oct 2021,"The purpose of the present document is to provide detailed information on the correct and optimal use of digital media to ensure continuity of care for gastroenterological patients in everyday clinical practice, in health emergencies and/or when the patient cannot reach the hospital for other reasons. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has allowed many patients with chronic diseases to access remote care worldwide, proving to be the ideal solution to overcome restrictions and carry out non-urgent routine follow-ups on chronic patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has therefore made organizational and cultural renewal essential for the reorganization of healthcare in order to ensure greater continuity of care with a minimum risk of spreading the virus to users, practitioners and their families. These AIGO recommendations are intended to provide Italian gastroenterologists with a tool to use this method appropriately, in compliance with current legislation, in particular the proper approach and procedures for conducting a remote examination using a video conferencing tool, the so-called televisit. In the near future, telemedicine may contribute to a possible reorganization of healthcare systems, through innovative care models focusing on the citizen and facilitating access to services throughout the entire Country.","Costantino, Andrea; Bortoluzzi, Francesco; Giuffrè, Mauro; Vassallo, Roberto; Montalbano, Luigi Maria; Monica, Fabio; Canova, Daniele; Checchin, Davide; Fedeli, Paolo; Marmo, Riccardo; Elli, Luca",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,1878-3562,10.1016/j.dld.2021.06.032,34312103,"Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.; Gastrointestinal Unit, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Venice, Italy; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy.; Department of Medical, Surgical, and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Buccheri la Ferla Hospital, Palermo, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia Cervello, Palermo, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy, Academic Hospital Cattinara, Trieste, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.; Gastrointestinal Unit, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Venice, Italy; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Santo Spirito Hospital, Rome, Italy.; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, PO Polla, ASL Salerno, Italy.; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy; Quality Committee, Italian Association Hospital Gastroenterologists and Endoscopists (AIGO), Rome, Italy.

We selected Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients who were detected Coronavirus positive (+) by RT-PCR nucleic acid test and later recovered. Furthermore, identified plant species from the surveys were thoroughly investigated for safety and efficacy based on the previous ethnomedicinal usage reports. Based on the published data, they were also reviewed for their significant potentialities as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agents. We explored comprehensive information about a total of 26 plant species, belonging to 23 genera and 17 different botanical families, used in COVID-19 treatment as home remedies by the respondents.

Pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel disease in context of SARS-COV-2 infection.,Jul 2021,"To date, the latest research results suggest that the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enter host cells directly via the gastrointestinal tract by binding to the enterocyte-expressed ACE2 receptor, or indirectly as a result of infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells. At the same time, entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the gastrointestinal tract initiates the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, the formation of an excessive inflammatory reaction and critical increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which, subsequently, can presumably increase inflammation and induce intestinal damage in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aims of the present review were to reveal and analyze possible molecular pathways and consequences of the induction of an innate and adaptive immune response during infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IBD. A thorough literature search was carried out by using the keywords: IBD, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19. Based on the screening, a number of intracellular and extracellular pathways were considered and discussed, which can impact the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients. Additionally, the possible consequences of the infection for such patients were estimated. We further hypothesize that any virus, including the new SARS-CoV-2, infecting intestinal tissues and/or entering the host's body through receptors located on intestinal enterocytes may be a trigger for the onset of IBD in individuals with a genetic predisposition and/or the risk of developing IBD associated with other factors.","Dvornikova, K A; Bystrova, E Yu; Churilov, L P; Lerner, A",Molecular biology reports,1573-4978,10.1007/s11033-021-06565-w,34296352,"Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. 691442@gmail.com.; Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation.; Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation.; Chaim Sheba Medical Center, The Zabludowicz Research Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Tel Hashomer, Israel.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34296352,
Hypopharyngeal Ulcers in COVID-19: Histopathological and Virological Analyses - A Case Report.,2021,"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ulcerative lesions have been episodically reported in various segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the oral cavity, oropharynx, esophagus, stomach and bowel. In this report, we describe an autopsy case of a COVID-19 patient who showed two undiagnosed ulcers at the level of the anterior and posterior walls of the hypopharynx. Molecular testing of viruses involved in pharyngeal ulcers demonstrated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, together with herpes simplex virus 1 DNA. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated full-thickness lympho-monocytic infiltration (mainly composed of CD68-positive cells), with hemorrhagic foci and necrosis of both the mucosal layer and deep skeletal muscle fibers. Fibrin and platelet microthrombi were also found. Cytological signs of HSV-1 induced damage were not found. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 were immunohistochemically identified in the inflammatory infiltrations. Immunohistochemistry for HSV1 showed general negativity for inflammatory infiltration, although in the presence of some positive cells. Thus, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular findings supported a direct role by SARS-CoV-2 in producing local ulcerative damage, although a possible contributory role by HSV-1 reactivation cannot be excluded. From a clinical perspective, this autopsy report of two undiagnosed lesions put the question if ulcers along the GI tract could be more common (but frequently neglected) in COVID-19 patients.","Porzionato, Andrea; Stocco, Elena; Emmi, Aron; Contran, Martina; Macchi, Veronica; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa; De Caro, Raffaele",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2021.676828,34290701,"Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Section of Human Anatomy, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290701,

The elderly IBD patient in the modern era: changing paradigms in risk stratification and therapeutic management.,2021,"The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rising in the elderly population. Compared with patients with onset during their younger years, patients with elderly onset IBD have a distinct clinical presentation, disease phenotype, and natural history. Genetics contribute less to pathogenesis of disease, whereas biological changes associated with aging including immunosenescence, dysbiosis, and frailty have a greater impact on disease outcomes.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflammatory bowel disease: The role of emotional stress and social isolation.,Apr 2022,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic health condition exacerbated by negative emotional stress experiences. In the current study, we examined whether the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with an increase in stress experiences and accordingly an aggravation of disease activity in IBD patients. Sixty-three IBD patients (30 Crohn's disease or CD, 33 ulcerative colitis) completed an online survey during the COVID-19-related lockdown, assessing clinical disease activity, disease-related quality of life, presence of functional gastrointestinal symptoms, social isolation and stress experiences. Scores were then compared to pre-lockdown baseline screening. The pandemic yielded a significant baseline-to-lockdown increase in emotional stress and social isolation. Stress increments, particularly those occasioned by interpersonal tension and excessive interpersonal proximity, were associated with a worsening of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Exacerbations of loneliness coincided with an escalation of CD activity, functional gastrointestinal symptoms and a decline in subjective health. Lastly, COVID-19 anxiety was significantly related to CD symptom severity and social dysfunction. The findings show that shifts in IBD expression are closely linked to changes in emotional stress experiences and interpersonal relatedness. As such, they contribute to a better understanding of inter-individual differences in IBD progression and provide leads for therapeutic interventions.","Nass, Boukje Yentl Sundari; Dibbets, Pauline; Markus, C Rob",Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,1532-2998,10.1002/smi.3080,34273129,"Department of Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Dr. Rath Health Foundation, Heerlen, The Netherlands.; Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.; Department of Neuropsychology and Psychopharmacology, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34273129,

Disease monitoring of biologic treatment in IBD: early impact and future implications of COVID-19 pandemic.,2021,"COVID-19 has dominated life in 2020 with, at the time of writing, over 4.9M global cases and >320 000 deaths. The impact has been most intensely felt in acute and critical care environments. However, with most UK elective work postponed, laboratory testing of faecal calprotectin halted due to potential risk of viral transmission and non-emergency endoscopies and surgeries cancelled, the secondary impact on chronic illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is becoming apparent. Data from the Scottish Biologic Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) service shows a dramatic drop in TDM testing since the pandemic onset. April 2020 saw a 75.6% reduction in adalimumab testing and a 36.2% reduction in infliximab testing when compared with February 2020 data, a reduction coinciding with the widespread cancellation of outpatient and elective activity. It is feared that disruption to normal patterns of care and disease monitoring of biologic patients could increase the risk of disease flare and adverse clinical outcomes. Urgent changes in clinical practice have been instigated to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on routine clinical care. Further transformations are needed to maintain safe, effective, patient-centred IBD care in the future.","Shields, Stephanie; Dunlop, Allan; Seenan, John Paul; Macdonald, Jonathan",Frontline gastroenterology,2041-4137,10.1136/flgastro-2020-101563,34249322,"Gastroenterology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Biochemistry, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Gastroenterology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Gastroenterology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34249322,

COVID-19 and its effects on the digestive system.,Jun 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with typical respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 invades not only the respiratory system, but also other organs expressing the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In particular, the digestive system is a susceptible target of SARS-CoV-2. Gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver damage. Patients with digestive damage have a greater chance of progressing to severe or critical illness, a poorer prognosis, and a higher risk of death. This paper aims to summarize the digestive system symptoms of COVID-19 and discuss fecal-oral contagion of SARS-CoV-2. It also describes the characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and discusses precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.

To Trap a Pathogen: Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and Their Role in Mucosal Epithelial and Skin Diseases.,Jun 2021,"Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating innate immune cells and comprise the first immune defense line, as they are the most rapidly recruited cells at sites of infection or inflammation. Their main microbicidal mechanisms are degranulation, phagocytosis, cytokine secretion and the formation of extracellular traps. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a microbicidal mechanism that involves neutrophil death. Since their discovery, in vitro and in vivo neutrophils have been challenged with a range of stimuli capable of inducing or inhibiting NET formation, with the objective to understand its function and regulation in health and disease. These networks composed of DNA and granular components are capable of immobilizing and killing pathogens. They comprise enzymes such as myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin G, acid hydrolases and cationic peptides, all with antimicrobial and antifungal activity. Therefore, the excessive formation of NETs can also lead to tissue damage and promote local and systemic inflammation.

"Impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, assessment and management of children with inflammatory bowel disease in the UK: implications for practice.",2020,"The assessment and management of patients with known, or suspected, paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) has been hugely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although current evidence of the impact of COVID-19 infection in children with PIBD has provided a degree of reassurance, there continues to be the potential for significant secondary harm caused by the changes to normal working practices and reorganisation of services. Disruption to the normal running of diagnostic and assessment procedures, such as endoscopy, has resulted in the potential for secondary harm to patients including delayed diagnosis and delay in treatment. Difficult management decisions have been made in order to minimise COVID-19 risk for this patient group while avoiding harm. Initiating and continuing immunosuppressive and biological therapies in the absence of normal surveillance and diagnostic procedures have posed many challenges. Despite this, changes to working practices, including virtual clinic appointments, home faecal calprotectin testing kits and continued intensive support from clinical nurse specialists and other members of the multidisciplinary team, have resulted in patients still receiving a high standard of care, with those who require face-to-face intervention being highlighted. These changes have the potential to revolutionise the way in which patients receive routine care in the future, with the inclusion of telemedicine increasingly attractive for stable patients. There is also the need to use lessons learnt from this pandemic to plan for a possible second wave, or future pandemics as well as implementing some permanent changes to normal working practices. In this review, we describe the diagnosis, management and direct impact of COVID-19 in paediatric patients with IBD. We summarise the guidance and describe the implemented changes, evolving evidence and the implications of this virus on paediatric patients with IBD and working practices.","Maclean, Abbie; Ashton, James J; Garrick, Vikki; Beattie, R Mark; Hansen, Richard",BMJ paediatrics open,2399-9772,10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000786,34192173,"School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Glasgow, UK.; Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Southampton Children's Hospital, Southampton, UK.; Department of Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.; Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.; Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Southampton Children's Hospital, Southampton, UK.; Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34192173,

COVID-19: biologic and immunosuppressive therapy in gastroenterology and hepatology.,Oct 2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis causing major challenges for clinical care in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Although triggering of anti-viral immune responses is essential for clearance of infection, some patients have severe lung inflammation and multiorgan failure due to marked immune cell dysregulation and cytokine storm syndrome. Importantly, the activation of cytotoxic follicular helper T cells and a reduction of regulatory T cells have a crucial, negative prognostic role. These findings lead to the question of whether immunosuppressive and biologic therapies for gastrointestinal diseases affect the incidence or prognosis of COVID-19 and, thus, whether they should be adjusted to prevent or affect the course of the disease. In this Review, data on the use of such therapies are discussed with a primary focus on inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis and liver transplantation. In particular, the roles of corticosteroids, classic immunosuppressive agents (such as thiopurines and mycophenolate mofetil), small molecules (such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors), and biologic agents (such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, vedolizumab and ustekinumab) are reviewed. Finally, the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines for the prevention of infection in patients with gastrointestinal diseases and concomitant immunosuppressive or biologic therapy will be discussed.","Neurath, Markus F",Nature reviews.

Increased colonic expression of ACE2 associates with poor prognosis in Crohn's disease.,Jun 2021,"The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is highly expressed in small intestine. Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course. We examined the expression of colonic ACE2 in 67 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR. We validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients. Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients which was defined as the ACE2-high CD subset. IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of CD diagnosis, and a Cox regression analysis found that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor for surgery (OR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.10-4.26; p = 0.025). Increased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients. These data point to the need for molecular stratification that can impact CD disease-related outcomes.","Toyonaga, Takahiko; Araba, Kenza C; Kennedy, Meaghan M; Keith, Benjamin P; Wolber, Elisabeth A;

Management of patients with Intestinal Bowel Disease and COVID-19: A review of current evidence and future perspectives.,May 2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for countries and health professionals worldwide. Viral entry by ACE-2 receptor and an excessive activation of the immune system are key to understand both incidence and severity of disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a special condition associated with an inordinate response of the immune system to external agents. IBD treatments have been associated to an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections. This has raised the question of possible higher incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in IBD patients. Several papers have been published during this year of pandemic to answer that question. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination offers great promise in controlling infection in patients with IBD. Based on current evidence, patients with IBD do not have a higher incidence of COVID-19 than the general population, and they do not have worse disease evolution. Advanced age and presence of a greater number of comorbidities have been associated with worse outcomes, similar to the general population. Corticosteroids are associated to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, higher hospitalization rate and higher risk of severe COVID-19. 5-ASA/Sulfasalazine and Thiopurines have a possible increased risk of severe COVID-19, although studies are lacking. On the other hand, Anti-TNF may have a possible protective effect. It is recommended to maintain the treatment. Anti-IL-12/23, anti-integrins and tofacitinib have results comparable to anti-TNF. Based on the efficacy, expert recommendations, and the absence of other evidence, it is recommended that patients with IBD be vaccinated.","Suria, Carles; Bosca-Watts, Marta M; Navarro, Pablo; Tosca, Joan; Anton, Rosario; Sanahuja, Ana; Revaliente, Marta; Minguez, Miguel",Gastroenterologia y hepatologia,0210-5705,10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.06.005,34171421,"Digestive Disease Department, University of Valencia, Clinic University Hospital of Valencia, Valencia 46010, Spain.

A Review of the Efficacy of Influenza Vaccination in Autoimmune Disease Patients.,May 2021,"Patients suffering from autoimmune diseases appear to be at greater risk for developing infections with the influenza virus compared to healthy controls due to their immunosuppressive treatment, suggesting the importance of vaccination. Within this literature review, we highlight the importance, efficacy, and safety of influenza vaccination in individuals with autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Overall, vaccination is generally well tolerated by SLE patients and the literature recommends the inactivated influenza vaccine to SLE patients according to the recommendations and schedules for the general population and annually against seasonal influenza viruses. While the data are still unclear in patients with SS, there does seem to be a general consensus to vaccinate these individuals to prevent harmful risks of influenza disease. In patients with RA and IBD, vaccination efficacy with the inactivated influenza vaccine should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking patient therapy into account. In light of the current pandemic and global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, it is crucial to emphasize the safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in vulnerable individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases. Public health measures are recommended to protect these individuals with vaccinations, keeping in mind the possibility of the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available.","Abdelahad, Mandi; Ta, Elizabeth; Kesselman, Marc M; Demory Beckler, Michelle",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.15016,34136315,"College of Osteopathic Medicine, Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C.

Therapeutic use of specific tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory diseases including COVID-19.,Aug 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant devastation globally. Despite the development of several vaccines, with uncertainty around global uptake and vaccine efficacy, the need for effective therapeutic agents remains.

7-Ketocholesterol: Effects on viral infections and hypothetical contribution in COVID-19.,Sep 2021,"7-Ketocholesterol, which is one of the earliest cholesterol oxidization products identified, is essentially formed by the auto-oxidation of cholesterol. In the body, 7-ketocholesterol is both provided by food and produced endogenously. This pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory molecule, which can activate apoptosis and autophagy at high concentrations, is an abundant component of oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins. 7-Ketocholesterol appears to significantly contribute to the development of age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and Alzheimer's disease), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and to certain cancers. Recent studies have also shown that 7-ketocholesterol has anti-viral activities, including on SARS-CoV-2, which are, however, lower than those of oxysterols resulting from the oxidation of cholesterol on the side chain. Furthermore, 7-ketocholesterol is increased in the serum of moderately and severely affected COVID-19 patients. In the case of COVID-19, it can be assumed that the antiviral activity of 7-ketocholesterol could be counterbalanced by its toxic effects, including pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities that might promote the induction of cell death in alveolar cells. It is therefore suggested that this oxysterol might be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 by contributing to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and promoting a deleterious, even fatal outcome. Thus, 7-ketocholesterol could possibly constitute a lipid biomarker of COVID-19 outcome and counteracting its toxic effects with adjuvant therapies might have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.","Ghzaiel, Imen; Sassi, Khouloud; Zarrouk, Amira; Nury, Thomas; Ksila, Mohamed; Leoni, Valerio; Bouhaouala-Zahar, Balkiss; Hammami, Sonia; Hammami, Mohamed; Mackrill, John J; Samadi, Mohammad; Ghrairi, Taoufik; Vejux, Anne; Lizard, Gérard",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,1879-1220,10.1016/j.jsbmb.2021.105939,34118414,"University Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Team 'Biochemistry of the Peroxisome, Inflammation and Lipid Metabolism' EA 7270 / Inserm, 21000 Dijon, France; University of Monastir, Faculty of Medicine, LR12ES05, Lab-NAFS 'Nutrition - Functional Food & Vascular Health', 5000 Monastir, Tunisia; University Tunis-El Manar, Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, 2092 Tunis, Tunisia.

Gastrointestinal Perspective of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children-An Updated Review.,Sep 2021,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common findings in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, including vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and difficulty in feeding, although these symptoms tend to be mild. The hepato-biliary system and the pancreas may also be involved, usually with a mild elevation of transaminases and, rarely, pancreatitis. In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis. Gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary manifestations are probably related to a loss in enterocyte absorption capability and microscopic mucosal damage caused by a viral infection of intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes and other cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 receptor resulting in immune cells activation with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. Specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplantation may pose a risk for the more severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but as adult data accumulate, paediatric data is still limited. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence about the effect of COVID-19 on the gastrointestinal system in children, with emphasis on the emerging MIS-C and specific considerations such as patients with IBD and liver transplant recipients.","Assa, Amit; Benninga, Marc A; Borrelli, Osvaldo; Broekaert, Ilse; de Carpi, Javier Martin; Saccomani, Marco Deganello; Dolinsek, Jernej; Mas, Emmanuel; Miele, Erasmo; Thomson, Mike; Tzivinikos, Christos; ,",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,1536-4801,10.1097/MPG.0000000000003204,34117195,"Department of Paediatrics, Assuta Ashdod University Hospital, Ashdod.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.; Department of Paediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Paediatrics, Woman's & Child's University Hospital of Verona, Italy.; Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia.; Unité de Gastroentérologie, Hépatologie, Nutrition et Maladies Héréditaires du Métabolisme, Hôpital des Enfants, and IRSD, Université de Toulouse, INSERM, INRAE, ENVT, UPS, Toulouse, France.; Department of Translational Medical Science, Section of Pediatrics, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.; Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Sheffield Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Weston Bank, Sheffield, UK.; Paediatric Gastroenterology Department, Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, Dubai, UAE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34117195,
Vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Dec 2021,"Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently requires administration of immunosuppressive therapies, which increases susceptibility to a number of infectious pathogens. However, many infections can be prevented by correct and appropriate utilization of vaccinations. While several guidelines have been published on vaccination schedules in patients with IBD, vaccination rates remain suboptimal and even lower than those in the general population. This is due to many factors including poor awareness of the importance of vaccines by gastroenterologists and general practitioners as well as potential prejudices of patients regarding the safety and benefits of vaccines. With the aim of increasing awareness about the key role of immunization in the management of patients with IBD, the present review examines the existing literature relating to the main vaccinations and their application in these patients. We also summarize current evidence in order to provide clinicians with an easy source of reference for the principal recommendations for prevention of infectious diseases in patients with IBD. In addition, the recommendations about traveling for IBD patients are briefly explored. Lastly, since it is important for gastroenterologists to be aware of recommendations on vaccination, we recommend implementing educational programs to ensure compliance with current guidelines.","Macaluso, Fabio Salvatore; Liguori, Giuseppina; Galli, Massimo",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,1878-3562,10.1016/j.dld.2021.05.015,34116972,"Department of Medicine, ''Villa Sofia-Cervello'' Hospital, Sicilian Network for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SN-IBD), Palermo, Italy.

Frequency of Vitamin D Deficiency in Patients of Asthma.,May 2021,"Introduction Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by reversible and recurrent airway obstruction leading to the symptoms of wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and respiratory distress. It is one of the most common lung pathologies worldwide. Its incidence is on the rise in Pakistan, which may be due to overt environmental pollution or improving screening protocols. Irrespective more and more patients are now being diagnosed as cases of asthma and this has led to renewed interest in research for the subject locally. Vitamin D plays a key component of the immune system and its deficiency has been associated with diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, sepsis, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The role of vitamin D in exacerbation, prevention, causation, and treatment of asthma is still up for debate. However, as more data emerges, it is becoming evident that vitamin D in one way or another is linked to outcomes in asthma. Especially the deficiency of vitamin D in asthma and its supplementation has garnered great attention in scientific trials. Our research is just one small step in this direction. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with asthma. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort conducted at the Department of Medicine of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital Karachi (ASHK) during March 2019 to August 2019. Patients of either gender aged ≥18 years that were diagnosed with cases of asthma were eligible to be included in the study. Asthma was defined in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the Pakistan Chest Society. A vitamin D level of <20 ng/dl was considered deficient. Patient confidentiality was made certain.  Results A total of 97 (62.98%) of the 154 patients included in the study had <20 ng/ml of vitamin D level. The mean vitamin D level recorded in this study was 15.34±4.21 ng/dl. The male-to-female ratio was 1:5. The mean age of our cohort was 42.78±4.56 years. The mean duration of disease, i.e., asthma was 6.7±3.68 years. Both the age of the patients and duration of the disease were found to be statistically significant with respect to vitamin D levels in asthmatics. Conclusions The frequency of vitamin D deficiency is very high in patients with asthma. These suboptimal levels are significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the duration of the disease.","Alvi, Souhaib; Syed, Jabbar Ghufran; Nusrat, Baakh; Abbas Razvi, Syed Kumail; Shah, Zunaira Z; Shafaat Khan, Yusra; Danish Khan, Muhammad; Ali Khan, Muhammad",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.14828,34104581,"Medicine, Abbassi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi, PAK.; General Surgery, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, PAK.; Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, PAK.; Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, PAK.; Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, PAK.; Medicine, Ziauddin University, Karachi, PAK.; Orthopedics, The Indus Hospital, Karachi, PAK.; Gastroenterology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, PAK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34104581,

Anti-COVID-19 measurements for hidradenitis suppurativa patients.,Jun 2021,"The reported incidence of COVID-19 among cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel and skin diseases under treatment with biologicals is low. Treatment may further modify disease severity as some biological modifiers, such as anakinra, are also proposed for the management of COVID-19 patients potentially providing HS patients with an advantage. The above preliminary evidence suggests that hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) does probably not provide an increased susceptibility for COVID-19 and that any susceptibility is unlikely to be modified negatively by treatment with biologicals. On the occasion of its 10th International Conference, experts of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V. have prepared a consensus statement regarding anti-COVID-19 measurements for HS patients. Based on the available knowledge, patients with HS may be vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 and patients affected by metabolic syndrome constitute a high-risk group for COVID-19 and should be vaccinated at the earliest convenient point in time. HS patients on treatment with adalimumab can be vaccinated with non-living virus anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccines. A possible suboptimal effect of the vaccine may be suspected but might not be expected universally. The management of the biological treatment in HS patients is at the discretion of the dermatologist / responsible physician.","Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Bettoli, Vincenzo; Jemec, Gregor B E; Del Marmol, Veronique; Marzano, Angelo V; Prens, Errol P; Tzellos, Thrasyvoulos; Zouboulis, Christos C",Experimental dermatology,1600-0625,10.1111/exd.14339,34085330,"European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Department of Medical Sciences, O.U. of Dermatology, Azienda Ospedaliera - University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Department of Dermatology, Zealand University Hospital, Faculty of Health Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Department of Dermatology, Hôpital Erasme, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Dermatology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.; Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Laboratory for Experimental Immunodermatology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Dermatology, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Department of Dermatology, NLSH University Hospital, Bodø, Norway.; European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V., Dessau, Germany.; Departments of Dermatology, Venereology, Allergology and Immunology, Dessau Medical Center, Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane and Faculty of Health Sciences Brandenburg, Dessau, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34085330,

Scoring Systems for Clinical Colon Capsule Endoscopy-All You Need to Know.,May 2021,"In the constantly developing era of minimal diagnostic invasiveness, the role of colon capsule endoscopy in colonic examination is being increasingly recognised, especially in the context of curtailed endoscopy services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a safe diagnostic tool with low adverse event rates. As with other endoscopic modalities, various colon capsule endoscopy scores allow the standardisation of reporting and reproducibility. As bowel cleanliness affects CCE's diagnostic yield, a few operator-dependent scores (Leighton-Rex and CC-CLEAR scores) and a computer-dependent score (CAC score) have been developed to grade bowel cleanliness objectively. CCE can be used to monitor IBD mucosal disease activity through the UCEIS and the panenteric CECDAIic score for UC and CD, respectively. CCE may also have a role in CRC screening, given similar sensitivity and specificity rates to conventional colonoscopy to detect colonic polyps ≥ 10 mm and CRC. Given CCE's diagnostic yield and reproducible clinical scores with high inter-observer agreements, CCE is fast becoming a suitable alternative to conventional colonoscopy in specific patient populations.","Tabone, Trevor; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios; Ellul, Pierre",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm10112372,34071209,"Gastroenterology Department, Mater Dei Hospital, MSD 2090 Msida, Malta.; Department of Social Medicine & Public Health, Pomeranian Medical University, 70-204 Szczecin, Poland.; Gastroenterology Department, Mater Dei Hospital, MSD 2090 Msida, Malta.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34071209,
The Role of IL-36 in Infectious Diseases: Potential Target for COVID-19?,2021,"IL-36 is a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine family, which is currently experiencing a renaissance due to the growing understanding of its context-dependent roles and advances in our understanding of the inflammatory response. The immunological role of IL-36 has revealed its profound and indispensable functional roles in psoriasis, as well as in several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cancer. More recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that IL-36 plays a crucial role in viral, bacterial and fungal infections. There is a growing interest as to whether IL-36 contributes to host protective immune responses against infection as well as the potential implications of IL-36 for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding cellular expression, regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of IL-36 in infectious diseases, which suggest more specific strategies to maneuver IL-36 as a diagnostic or therapeutic target, especially in COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaofang; Yi, Panpan; Liang, Yuejin",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2021.662266,34054828,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, United States.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Viral Hepatitis of Hunan, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, United States.; Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34054828,

Receptor for advanced glycation end-products axis and coronavirus disease 2019 in inflammatory bowel diseases: A dangerous liaison?,May 2021,"Compelling evidence supports the crucial role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) axis activation in many clinical entities. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is an increasing concern about the risk and handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, clinical data raised during pandemic suggests that IBD patients do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe course of infection. In the present review, we intend to highlight how two potentially important contributors to the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients, the RAGE axis activation as well as the cross-talk with the renin-angiotensin system, are dampened by the high expression of soluble forms of both RAGE and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. The soluble form of RAGE functions as a decoy for its ligands, and soluble ACE2 seems to be an additionally attenuating contributor to RAGE axis activation, particularly by avoiding the transactivation of the RAGE axis that can be produced by the virus-mediated imbalance of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II receptor type 1 pathway.","Rojas, Armando; Schneider, Iván; Lindner, Cristian; Gonzàlez, Ileana; Morales, Miguel Angel",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v27.i19.2270,34040321,"Biomedical Research Labs, Medicine Faculty, Catholic University of Maule, Talca 3634000, Chile. arojasr@ucm.cl.; Biomedical Research Labs, Medicine Faculty, Catholic University of Maule, Talca 3634000, Chile.; Biomedical Research Labs, Medicine Faculty, Catholic University of Maule, Talca 3634000, Chile.; Biomedical Research Labs, Medicine Faculty, Catholic University of Maule, Talca 3634000, Chile.; Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology Program, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago 8320000, Chile.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34040321,

"Gastric cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity in a 17-year-old boy: CTLA-4 deficiency successfully treated with Abatacept.",Dec 2021,"Gut involvement is frequent in immunologic disorders, especially with inflammatory manifestations but also with cancer. In the last years, advances in functional and genetic testing have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to immune dysregulation syndromes. CTLA-4 deficiency is a rare disease with variable phenotype, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe multisystem manifestations and complications. We describe a rare case of CTLA-4 deficiency in a boy with gastric cancer, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity, the second-ever reported in the literature with the same characteristics. A 17-year-old boy was referred to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital of Rome, a tertiary care center, for a gastric mass and a long-term history of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, polyarthritis and psoriasis. Histology of gastric biopsies revealed the presence of neoplastic signet ring cells. Imaging staging showed localized cancer; therefore, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with termino-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Immunological work up and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing panels for primary immunodeficiencies led to the diagnosis of CTLA-4 deficiency. Good disease control was obtained with the administration of Abatacept. The patient experienced an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without any concern. Eighteen months after treatment initiation, the patient is alive and well.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for autoimmune diseases in the time of COVID-19: EBMT guidelines and recommendations.,Jul 2021,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents one of the biggest challenges of 21st century, threatening public health around the globe. Increasing age and presence of co-morbidities are reported risk factors for severe disease and mortality, along with autoimmune diseases (ADs) and immunosuppressive treatments such as haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which are also associated with adverse outcomes. We review the impact of the pandemic on specific groups of patients with neurological, rheumatological, and gastroenterological indications, along with the challenges delivering HSCT in adult and pediatric populations. Moving forward, we developed consensus-based guidelines and recommendations for best practice and quality of patient care in order to support clinicians, scientists, and their multidisciplinary teams, as well as patients and their carers. These guidelines aim to support national and international organizations related to autoimmune diseases and local clinical teams delivering HSCT. Areas of unmet need and future research questions are also highlighted. The waves of the COVID-19 pandemic are predicted to be followed by an ""endemic"" phase and therefore an ongoing risk within a ""new normality"". These recommendations reflect currently available evidence, coupled with expert opinion, and will be revised according to necessary modifications in practice.","Greco, Raffaella; Alexander, Tobias; Burman, Joachim; Del Papa, Nicoletta; de Vries-Bouwstra, Jeska; Farge, Dominique; Henes, Jörg; Kazmi, Majid; Kirgizov, Kirill; Muraro, Paolo A; Ricart, Elena; Rovira, Montserrat; Saccardi, Riccardo; Sharrack, Basil; Snarski, Emilian; Withers, Barbara; Jessop, Helen; Boglione, Claudia; Kramer, Ellen; Badoglio, Manuela; Labopin, Myriam; Orchard, Kim; Corbacioglu, Selim; Ljungman, Per; Mikulska, Malgorzata; De la Camara, Rafael; Snowden, John A; ,",Bone marrow transplantation,1476-5365,10.1038/s41409-021-01326-6,34031556,"Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. greco.raffaella@hsr.it.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Scleroderma Clinic, Dip.

AGA Rapid Review and Guideline for SARS-CoV2 Testing and Endoscopy Post-Vaccination: 2021 Update.,Sep 2021,"This guideline provides updated recommendations on the role of preprocedure testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in individuals undergoing endoscopy in the post-vaccination period and replaces the prior guideline from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) (released July 29, 2020). Since the start of the pandemic, our increased understanding of transmission has facilitated the implementation of practices to promote patient and health care worker (HCW) safety. Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care, as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGA's prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy; patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy; effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission; patient and HCW anxiety; patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden; and endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine preprocedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine preprocedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy. The panel placed a high value on minimizing additional delays in patient care, acknowledging the reduced endoscopy volumes, downstream impact on delayed cancer diagnoses, and burden of testing on patients.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Siddique, Shazia M; Singh, Siddharth; Altayar, Osama; Caliendo, Angela M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Kaul, Vivek; Lim, Joseph K; Mustafa, Reem A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Inadomi, John M; ,",Gastroenterology,1528-0012,10.1053/j.gastro.2021.05.039,34029569,"Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: report of three cases and discussion of treatment options.,2021,"In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is unclear how asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients who present with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) can be treated effectively and safely. Standard treatment regimens consist of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, but therapeutic decision-making becomes challenging as there are uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC. Importantly, guidelines for this particular group of patients with UC are still lacking. To inform therapeutic decision-making, we describe three consecutive cases of patients with active UC and COVID-19 and discuss their treatments based on theoretical knowledge, currently available evidence and clinical observations. Three patients were identified through our national inflammatory bowel disease network [Initiative on Crohn's and Colitis (ICC)] for whom diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection was established by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in nasopharynx, stools, and/or biopsies. Acute severe UC was diagnosed by clinical parameters, endoscopy, and histopathology. Clinical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients advocate the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-antagonists as induction therapy, and experiences from the current three cases show that steroids and TNF-α-antagonists could also be used in patients with COVID-19. This could potentially be followed by TNF-α-antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in these patients. Future research is warranted to investigate if, and which, immunomodulatory drugs should be used for COVID-19 patients that present with active UC. To answer this question, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in international registries, such as the SECURE-IBD registry.","Bourgonje, Arno R; van Linschoten, Reinier C A; West, Rachel L; van Dijk, Maarten A; van Leer-Buter, Coretta C; Kats-Ugurlu, Gursah; Pierik, Marieke J; Festen, Eleonora A M; Weersma, Rinse K; Dijkstra, Gerard",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,1756-283X,10.1177/17562848211012595,33995584,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, 9700 RB, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Elkerliek Hospital, Helmond, the Netherlands.; Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Maastricht, University Medical Center Maastricht, Maastricht, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33995584,

A recommended paradigm for vaccination of rheumatic disease patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.,Jul 2021,"Autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic disorders (ARD) are treated with antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors and biologic agents either neutralizing cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17, B-cell activating factor] or being directed against B-cells (anti-CD-20), costimulatory molecules or JAK kinases. Similarly for the influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, there is limited data on the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 prevention for this susceptible patient population. Moreover, preliminary data from vaccinated organ transplanted, inflammatory bowel and connective tissue disease patients suggests only limited immunogenicity after the first vaccine dose, particularly in patients on immunosuppressive regimens. Herein a set of recommendations for the vaccination of immune suppressed patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is proposed aimed at achieving optimal vaccine benefit without interfering with disease activity status. Moreover, rare autoimmune adverse events related to vaccinations are discussed.","Moutsopoulos, Haralampos M",Journal of autoimmunity,1095-9157,10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102649,33984571,"Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece.

Targeting Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling in Immune-Mediated Diseases: Beyond Multiple Sclerosis.,Jun 2021,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid metabolite that exerts its actions by engaging 5 G-protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-S1PR5). S1P receptors are involved in several cellular and physiological events, including lymphocyte/hematopoietic cell trafficking. An S1P gradient (low in tissues, high in blood), maintained by synthetic and degradative enzymes, regulates lymphocyte trafficking. Because lymphocytes live long (which is critical for adaptive immunity) and recirculate thousands of times, the S1P-S1PR pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. The S1PR1 modulators lead to receptor internalization, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation, which renders lymphocytes incapable of following the S1P gradient and prevents their access to inflammation sites. These drugs might also block lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes by inhibiting transendothelial migration. Targeting S1PRs as a therapeutic strategy was first employed for multiple sclerosis (MS), and four S1P modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod) are currently approved for its treatment. New S1PR modulators are under clinical development for MS, and their uses are being evaluated to treat other immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and psoriasis. A clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 treated with ozanimod is ongoing. Ozanimod and etrasimod have shown promising results in IBD; while in phase 2 clinical trials, ponesimod has shown improvement in 77% of the patients with psoriasis. Cenerimod and amiselimod have been tested in SLE patients. Fingolimod, etrasimod, and IMMH001 have shown efficacy in RA preclinical studies. Concerns relating to S1PR modulators are leukopenia, anemia, transaminase elevation, macular edema, teratogenicity, pulmonary disorders, infections, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, S1PR modulators exhibit different pharmacokinetics; a well-established first-dose event associated with S1PR modulators can be mitigated by gradual up-titration. In conclusion, S1P modulators represent a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for immune-mediated diseases.","Pérez-Jeldres, Tamara; Alvarez-Lobos, Manuel; Rivera-Nieves, Jesús",Drugs,1179-1950,10.1007/s40265-021-01528-8,33983615,"Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.; Hospital San Borja-Arriarán, Santiago, Chile.; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.; Hospital San Borja-Arriarán, Santiago, Chile.; San Diego VA Medical Center (SDVAMC), San Diego, CA, USA. jriveranieves@ucsd.edu.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego (UCSD), 9500 Gilman Drive Bldg.

"5-Hydroxytryptamine, Glutamate, and ATP: Much More Than Neurotransmitters.",2021,"5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is derived from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan. Although the compound has been studied extensively for its neuronal handling and synaptic actions, serotonin 5-HT receptors can be found extra-synaptically and not only in neurons but in many types of mammalian cells, inside and outside the central nervous system (CNS). In sharp contrast, glutamate (Glu) and ATP are better known as metabolism-related molecules, but they also are neurotransmitters, and their receptors are expressed on almost any type of cell inside and outside the nervous system. Whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine and Glu are key regulators of the immune system, ATP actions are more general. 5-hydroxytryptamine, ATP and Glu act through both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and ionotropic receptors, i.e., ligand gated ion channels. These are the three examples of neurotransmitters whose actions as holistic regulatory molecules are briefly put into perspective here.","Franco, Rafael; Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Lillo, Jaume; Camps, Jordi; Navarro, Gemma; Reyes-Resina, Irene",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2296-634X,10.3389/fcell.2021.667815,33937270,"Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, School of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación en Red, Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIberNed), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, School of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación en Red, Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIberNed), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, School of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación en Red, Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIberNed), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, School of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Centro de Investigación en Red, Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIberNed), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, School of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33937270,
How to Manage COVID-19 Vaccination in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: An Expert Opinion by IMIDs Study Group.,2021,"Since March 2020, the outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 pandemic has changed medical practice and daily routine around the world. Huge efforts from pharmacological industries have led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Clinical trials on these vaccines have been published on the general population showing a high efficacy with minor adverse events. However, specific data about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are still lacking. Moreover, the limited availability of these vaccines requires prioritizing some vulnerable categories of patients compared to others.

Telemedicine and Integrated Multidisciplinary Care for Pediatric IBD Patients: A Review.,Apr 2021,"The global COVID-19 pandemic brought with it an unprecedented, widespread implementation of telemedicine services, requiring pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) providers to shift in-person clinic visits to a virtual platform. With the passing of the one-year anniversary of the global pandemic, telemedicine continues to be offered and utilized. Although it remains unclear as to the extent to which telemedicine services will be used in the future, it is critical to understand how integrated multidisciplinary treatment-the standard of care in pediatric IBD-is delivered through a virtual platform. This paper provides an overview of the existing literature examining integrated multidisciplinary care for pediatric IBD provided via telemedicine. The author also presents one integrated multidisciplinary IBD program's response to the global pandemic and subsequent transition to telemedicine. Challenges around implementation and directions for future research in this area are also discussed.","Potthoff, Lauren M","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2227-9067,10.3390/children8050347,33924754,"Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Pritzker Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Ann & Robert H.

Applying Telemedicine to Multidisciplinary Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care.,Apr 2021,"Multidisciplinary care is essential to the delivery of comprehensive, whole-person care for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Team members may include medical, psychosocial, and ancillary providers as well as patient and family advocates. There is significant variability in how this care is delivered from center to center, though prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most care occurred during in-person visits. At the onset of the pandemic, medical systems world-wide were challenged to continue delivering high quality, comprehensive care, requiring many centers to turn to telemedicine technology. The aim of this manuscript is to describe the process by which we converted our multidisciplinary pediatric and adolescent IBD visits to a telemedicine model by leveraging technology, a multidisciplinary team, and quality improvement (QI) methods. Finally, we put our experience into context by summarizing the literature on telemedicine in IBD care, with a focus on pediatrics and multidisciplinary care.","Michel, Hilary K; Maltz, Ross M; Boyle, Brendan; Donegan, Amy; Dotson, Jennifer L","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2227-9067,10.3390/children8050315,33919417,"Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Nationwide Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Nationwide Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.; The Center for Microbial Pathogenesis, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Nationwide Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Nationwide Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.; Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Nationwide Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.; The Center for Innovation in Pediatric Practice, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33919417,

Discovery of a AHR pelargonidin agonist that counter-regulates Ace2 expression and attenuates ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 interaction.,Jun 2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is the pathogenetic agent of Corona Virus Induced Disease (COVID)19. The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of Ace2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent TNBS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of Ace2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of Ace2 mRNA were directly correlated with Tnf-α mRNA levels. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.","Biagioli, Michele; Marchianò, Silvia; Roselli, Rosalinda; Di Giorgio, Cristina; Bellini, Rachele; Bordoni, Martina; Gidari, Anna; Sabbatini, Samuele; Francisci, Daniela; Fiorillo, Bianca; Catalanotti, Bruno; Distrutti, Eleonora; Carino, Adriana; Zampella, Angela; Costantino, Gabriele; Fiorucci, Stefano",Biochemical pharmacology,1873-2968,10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114564,33872570,"Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy.; University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy.; SC di Gastroenterologia ed Epatologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; University of Naples Federico II, Department of Pharmacy, Naples, Italy.; Department of Food and Drugs, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.

Biologic Treatment Algorithms for Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis with Comorbid Conditions and Special Populations: A Review.,Jul 2021,"The emergence of data from clinical trials of biologics, the approval of new biologics, and our improved understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis have increased the therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Biologics currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors, ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor), and IL-23 inhibitors. Data from clinical trials and studies of the safety and efficacy of biologics provide essential information for the personalization of patient care. We discuss the benefits and disadvantages of biologics as a first-line treatment choice, update treatment recommendations according to current evidence, and propose psoriasis treatment algorithms. Our discussion includes the following comorbid conditions: psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B, nonmelanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and latent tuberculosis. We make evidence-based treatment recommendations for special populations, including pediatric patients, patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and pregnant and breastfeeding patients with psoriasis. Ultimately, individualized recommendations that consider patient preferences, disease severity, comorbid conditions, and additional risk factors should be offered to patients and updated as new trial data emerges.","Thatiparthi, Akshitha; Martin, Amylee; Liu, Jeffrey; Egeberg, Alexander; Wu, Jashin J",American journal of clinical dermatology,1179-1888,10.1007/s40257-021-00603-w,33861409,"College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA.; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, NV, Denmark.; Dermatology Research and Education Foundation, Irvine, CA, USA. jashinwu@hotmail.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861409,

How to Face the Advent of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in IBD Patients: Another Task for Gastroenterologists.,Mar 2021,"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection since this seems to be the most effective strategy to counter the pandemic. In the past weeks, the administration of vaccines has started in different parts of the world sustaining the hype of significantly containing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the rapid time lapse from vaccine development to distribution has raised several concerns on its safety and efficacy. This topic is particularly felt by patients with chronic conditions and immumodulating therapies that could compromise their immune system such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we explore the potential future implications of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines introduction in the IBD field, touching upon the clinical experience coming from available data on vaccinations against other infections.

CD26/Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV and Its Multiple Biological Functions.,Feb 2021,"CD26/Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a cell surface glycoprotein with numerous roles including glucose metabolism, immunomodulation, and tumorigenesis. CD26/DPPIV is well recognized in diabetes, with DPPIV inhibitors being a class of oral hypoglycemic drugs called gliptins that are commonly used to treat type two diabetes mellitus. Recent work also indicated a potential role for CD26 in infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and immune-mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and graft-versus-host disease. In cancer, CD26/DPPIV expression has been characterized in numerous tumors such as hematologic malignancies, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer. Hence, CD26 has been frequently studied as a tumor biomarker and therapeutic target. CD26/DPPIV-targeted therapies have been evaluated in various cancers, including the use of anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies as anticancer treatment in selected neoplasms. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of CD26 in cancer, diabetes, immune-mediated diseases, and infectious diseases. Enhanced understanding of CD26 biology and function may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in multiple human diseases.","Pan, Kelsey; Ohnuma, Kei; Morimoto, Chikao; Dang, Nam H",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.13495,33777580,"Internal Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.; Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Juntendo University, Tokyo, JPN.; Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Juntendo University, Tokyo, JPN.; Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33777580,
How to manage inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: A guide for the practicing clinician.,Mar 2021,"Managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a challenge faced by clinicians and their patients, especially concerning whether to proceed with biologics and immunosuppressive agents in the background of a global outbreak of a highly contagious new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). The knowledge about the impact of this virus on patients with IBD, although it is still scarce, is rapidly evolving. In particular, concerns surrounding medications' impact for IBD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing COVID-19, and potentially exacerbate viral replication and the COVID-19 course, are a current thinking of both practicing clinicians and providers caring for patients with IBD. Managing patients with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 depends on both the clinical activity of the IBD and the occasional development and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current data regarding gastrointestinal involvement by SARS-CoV-2 and pharmacologic and surgical management for IBD concerning this infection, and the COVID-19 impact on both the patient's psychological functioning and endoscopy services, and we concisely summarize the telemedicine roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chebli, Júlio Maria Fonseca; Queiroz, Natália Sousa Freitas; Damião, Adérson Omar Mourão Cintra; Chebli, Liliana Andrade; Costa, Márcia Henriques de Magalhães; Parra, Rogério Serafim",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v27.i11.1022,33776370,"Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora 36036-900, MG, Brazil.; Department of Gastroenterology, University of São Paulo School of Medicine, São Paulo 05403-000, SP, Brazil.; Department of Gastroenterology, University of São Paulo School of Medicine, São Paulo 05403-000, SP, Brazil.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora 36036-900, MG, Brazil.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Fluminense Federal University, Rio de Janeiro 24210-200, RJ, Brazil.; Department of Surgery and Anatomy, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto 14048-900, SP, Brazil. rsparra@hcrp.usp.br.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33776370,

Implications of SARS-COV-2 infection in the diagnosis and management of the pediatric gastrointestinal disease.,Mar 2021,"Gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), inflammatory bowel disease (IBDs) and acute or chronic diarrhea are quite frequent in the pediatric population. The approach, the diagnosis and management can be changed in the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era. This review has focused on: i) the current understanding of digestive involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected children and adolescents and the clinical implications of COVID-19 for pediatric gastroenterologists, ii) the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical approach to patients with pre-existing or onset diseases, including diagnosis and treatment, and iii) the role and limited access to the instrumental diagnosis such as digestive endoscopy. To date, it is unclear if immunosuppression in patients with IBD and chronic liver disease represents a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Scheduled outpatient follow-up visits may be postponed, especially in patients in remission. Conversely, telemedicine services are strongly recommended. The introduction of new therapeutic regimens should be made on an individual basis, discussing the benefits and risks with each patient. Furthermore, psychological care in all children with chronic disease and their parents should be ensured. All non-urgent and elective endoscopic procedures may be postponed as they must be considered at high risk of viral transmission. Finally, until SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not available, strict adherence to standard social distancing protocols and the use of personal protective equipment should continue to be recommended.","Dipasquale, Valeria; Passanisi, Stefano; Cucinotta, Ugo; Cascio, Antonio; Romano, Claudio",Italian journal of pediatrics,1824-7288,10.1186/s13052-021-01020-9,33761992,"Pediatric Gastroenterology and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""G.

Integrated intra- and intercellular signaling knowledge for multicellular omics analysis.,Mar 2021,"Molecular knowledge of biological processes is a cornerstone in omics data analysis. Applied to single-cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath's web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug-in, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell-cell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes.

Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in gastroenterology and its current epidemiological situation: An updated review until January 2021.,2021,"Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses that infect amphibians, birds, and mammals. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major health problem caused by one of the coronaviruses called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has spread fast throughout the globe since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although COVID-19 is principally defined by its respiratory symptoms, it is now clear that the virus can also affect the digestive system causing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain as a major complaint. GI symptoms could be the initial signs of preceding respiratory signs, carrying a potential for slowed investigation and raised disease transmission opportunities. Various studies recognized the COVID-19 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is highly expressed in GI epithelial cells. Many cases were reported negative using nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in their anal/rectal swabs and stool specimens. These suggest that COVID-19 can actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. In this review, we elaborate on the close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the digestive system, focusing on the current status in the field of COVID-19 in gastroenterology, liver injury, endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, imaging, and the potential underlying mechanisms with illustrating the current epidemiological status regarding this pandemic.","Nabil, Ahmed; Elshemy, Mohamed M; Uto, Koichiro; Soliman, Reham; Hassan, Ayman A; Shiha, Gamal; Ebara, Mitsuhiro",EXCLI journal,1611-2156,10.17179/excli2021-3417,33746667,"Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), 1-1Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan.; Biotechnology and Life Sciences Department, Faculty of Postgraduate Studies for Advanced Sciences (PSAS), Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.; Egyptian Liver Research Institute and Hospital (ELRIAH), Sherbin, El Mansoura, Egypt.; Faculty of Science, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Egypt.; Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), 1-1Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan.; Egyptian Liver Research Institute and Hospital (ELRIAH), Sherbin, El Mansoura, Egypt.; Tropical Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Port Said University, Egypt.; Egyptian Liver Research Institute and Hospital (ELRIAH), Sherbin, El Mansoura, Egypt.; Egyptian Liver Research Institute and Hospital (ELRIAH), Sherbin, El Mansoura, Egypt.; Hepatology and Gastroenterology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.; Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), 1-1Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan.; Graduate School of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8577, Japan.; Graduate School of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, 6-3-1 Niijuku, Katsushika-ku, Tokyo 125-8585, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33746667,

Calcium activity in response to nAChR ligands in murine bone marrow granulocytes with different Gr-1 expression.,Jul 2021,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) are the largest proportion of leukocytes in adult human blood that perform numerous functions, including phagocytosis, degranulation, generation of reactive oxygen species, and NETosis. Excessive neutrophil activity associates with hyperinflammation and tissue damage during pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and coronavirus disease 2019. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can modulate immune cells, including neutrophils, functions, therefore, nAChR ligands are considered as the potent agents for therapy of inflammation. Earlier it was shown, that about 30% of PMNs from the acute inflammatory site responded to nicotine by calcium spikes. In this study, we studied the generation of calcium spikes in murine granulocytes with different maturity level (evaluated by Gr-1 expression) isolated from bone marrow in response to ligands of nAChRs in control and under chronic nicotine consumption. It was found that nearly 20%-25% cells in the granulocyte population responded to nicotine or selective antagonists of different type of nAChRs (α-cobratoxin, GIC, and Vc1.1).

Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19.,Dec 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory viral infection, has affected more than 78 million individuals worldwide as of the end of December 2020. Previous studies reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infections may affect the gastrointestinal (GI) system. In this review we outline the important GI manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and their diagnosis and management. GI manifestations are reported in 11.4-61.1% of individuals with COVID-19, with variable onset and severity. The majority of COVID-19-associated GI symptoms are mild and self-limiting and include anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain/discomfort. A minority of patients present with an acute abdomen with aetiologies such as acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, bowel ischaemia, haemoperitoneum or abdominal compartment syndrome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA has been found in biopsies from all parts of the alimentary canal. Involvement of the GI tract may be due to direct viral injury and/or an inflammatory immune response and may lead to malabsorption, an imbalance in intestinal secretions and gut mucosal integrity and activation of the enteric nervous system. Supportive and symptomatic care is the mainstay of therapy. However, a minority may require surgical or endoscopic treatment for acute abdomen and GI bleeding.","Kariyawasam, Jayani C; Jayarajah, Umesh; Riza, Rishdha; Abeysuriya, Visula; Seneviratne, Suranjith L",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,1878-3503,10.1093/trstmh/trab042,33728439,"Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka.; Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka.; Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka.; Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals, Colombo, Sri Lanka.; Nawaloka Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Nawaloka Hospitals, Colombo, Sri Lanka.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33728439,
"Colonic Ileus, Distension, and Ischemia Due to COVID-19-Related Colitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.",Feb 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly presents with respiratory symptoms, however, the involvement of the gastrointestinal system has also been reported. Isolated gastrointestinal manifestation due to COVID-19 presenting as colonic distension is uncommon. Colonic ileus from COVID-19 infection presents as dilatation on imaging, with the risk of subsequent ischemia and perforation if not recognized and treated promptly. There is no consensus on the treatment modality for COVID-19-related colitis, however, COVID-19-targeted medications in conjunction with surgical intervention have been performed for management. We present a case of a 73-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, distention, and diarrhea. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was found to have marked dilatation of the colon on imaging. He was initially given convalescent plasma to reduce inflammatory markers, as tocilizumab was contraindicated due to suspected bowel obstruction. Once more stable, he underwent surgical intervention followed by tocilizumab infusion. Pathological specimens of the colon demonstrated hemorrhagic colitis with microthrombi suggestive of COVID-19-related colitis.  Recognizing COVID-19-related colitis allows for timely diagnosis and management with targeted interventions in addition to surgery, which may prevent perforation. We suggest convalescent plasma followed by the formation of colostomy and finally infusion of tocilizumab as a feasible option for the treatment of COVID-19-related colitis. However, further research is needed in order to fully understand this entity and provide guidance for its management.","Shaikh, Danial H; Patel, Harish; Makker, Jasbir; Badipatla, Kanthi; Chilimuri, Sridhar",Cureus,2168-8184,10.7759/cureus.13236,33728185,"Gastroenterology, BronxCare Health System, New York, USA.; Gastroenterology, BronxCare Health System, New York, USA.; Gastroenterology, BronxCare Health System, New York, USA.; Gastroenterology, BronxCare Health System, New York, USA.; Gastroenterology, BronxCare Health System, New York, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33728185,

We review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relevant to IBD patients, including immune responses from humoral to cellular, emerging data on new variants, and off-label vaccination schemes. We also identify clinical and scientific knowledge gaps that can be translated into both large-scale population-based studies and targeted vaccine studies to describe the precise immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in IBD patients.

Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Pathogenic Mechanisms and Clinical Translation.,2021,"The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) are characterised by chronic non-resolving gut mucosal inflammation involving innate and adaptive immune responses. Neutrophils, usually regarded as first responders in inflammation, are a key presence in the gut mucosal inflammatory milieu in IBD. Here, we review the role of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a potential effector disease mechanism. NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins and oxidative enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain pathogens. NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; and recently, as a major tissue damaging process involved in the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. NETs are pertinent as a defence mechanism at the gut mucosal interphase exposed to high levels of bacteria, viruses and fungi. On the other hand, NETs can also potentiate and perpetuate gut inflammation. In this review, we discuss the broad protective vs. pathogenic roles of NETs, explanatory factors that could lead to an increase in NET formation in IBD and how NETs may contribute to gut inflammation and IBD-related complications. Finally, we summarise therapeutic opportunities to target NETs in IBD.","Drury, Broc; Hardisty, Gareth; Gray, Robert D; Ho, Gwo-Tzer",Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,2352-345X,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.03.002,33689803,"Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.; Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.; Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.; Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom.

Successful Distancing: Telemedicine in Gastroenterology and Hepatology During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Apr 2021,"Telemedicine involves delivering healthcare and preventative care services to patients without the need for in-person encounters. Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant",Digestive diseases and sciences,1573-2568,10.1007/s10620-021-06874-x,33655456,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.; The Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education, 501 S.

How Do We Move Type 1 Diabetes Immunotherapies Forward During the Current COVID-19 Pandemic?,May 2021,"Research-based immunotherapy trials seeking to prevent or reverse a number of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, have seen near universal suspension due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Recent data in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes suggest no increased risk of COVID-19. Even with immense appreciation for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, we believe compelling arguments exist to carefully and thoughtfully resume certain type 1 diabetes phase 2-3 immunotherapy trials.

Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Involvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Interactions with Gut Microbiota.,Jan 2021,"The gut-brain axis describes a complex interplay between the central nervous system and organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Sensory neurons of dorsal root and nodose ganglia, neurons of the autonomic nervous system, and immune cells collect and relay information about the status of the gut to the brain. A critical component in this bi-directional communication system is the vagus nerve which is essential for coordinating the immune system's response to the activities of commensal bacteria in the gut and to pathogenic strains and their toxins. Local control of gut function is provided by networks of neurons in the enteric nervous system also called the 'gut-brain'. One element common to all of these gut-brain systems is the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These ligand-gated ion channels serve myriad roles in the gut-brain axis including mediating fast synaptic transmission between autonomic pre- and postganglionic neurons, modulation of neurotransmitter release from peripheral sensory and enteric neurons, and modulation of cytokine release from immune cells. Here we review the role of nicotinic receptors in the gut-brain axis with a focus on the interplay of these receptors with the gut microbiome and their involvement in dysregulation of gut function and inflammatory bowel diseases.","Rueda Ruzafa, Lola; Cedillo, José Luis; Hone, Arik J",International journal of environmental research and public health,1660-4601,10.3390/ijerph18031189,33572734,"Laboratory of Neuroscience, Biomedical Research Center (CINBIO), University of Vigo, 36310 Vigo, Spain.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28034 Madrid, Spain.; MIRECC, George E.

A Supporting System for Management of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease during COVID-19 Outbreak: Iranian Experience-Study Protocol.,Oct 2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health care infrastructure dramatically, with abundant resources necessarily being redirected to COVID-19 patients and their care. Also, patients with chronic diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be affected in several ways during this pandemic. METHODS We used the Iranian registry of Crohn's and colitis (IRCC) infrastructure. We called and sent messages to follow-up and support the care of all registered patients. Besides, we prepared and distributed educational materials for these patients and physicians to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. We risk-stratified them and prepared outpatient clinics and hospitalization guidance for IBD patients. RESULTS Of 13165 Iranian patients with IBD, 51 have been diagnosed as having COVID-19. IBD patients made 1920 hotline calls. Among the patients with suspicious presentations, 14 COVID-19 infections were diagnosed. Additionally, 1782 patients with IBD from five provinces actively phone-called among whom 28 definite cases were diagnosed. CONCLUSION IBD patients' follow-up could help in diagnosing the affected IBD patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the performance of protective actions and preparing the patients and physicians for decisive proceedings are the principles of protection of IBD patients.","Anushiravani, Amir; Vahedi, Homayoon; Fakheri, Hafez; Mansour-Ghanaei, Fariborz; Maleki, Iradj; Nasseri-Moghaddam, Siavosh; Vosoghinia, Hasan; Ghadir, Mohammad Reza; Hormati, Ahmad; Aminisani, Nayyereh; Radmard, Amir Reza; Khosravi, Bardia; Saberzadeh-Ardestani, Bahar; Malekzadeh, Masoud; Alatab, Sudabeh; Sadeghi, Anahita; Salahi, Sarvenaz; Malekzadeh, Reza; Sima, Ali Reza",Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2008-5230,10.34172/mejdd.2020.188,33564380,"Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gut and Liver Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.; Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.; Gut and Liver Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Hepatology Diseases Research Center, Qom University of Medical Science, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Hepatology Diseases Research Center, Qom University of Medical Science, Iran.; Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Epidemiology and Statistics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran.; Department of Radiology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Minimally Invasive Surgery Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Digestive Disease Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33564380,

Respiratory Tract Infections in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Taking Vedolizumab: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) taking immunosuppressants or biologics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of respiratory infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with vedolizumab. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing vedolizumab to placebo in patients with IBD. Outcomes were the rate of respiratory tract infections (RTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among patients receiving vedolizumab as compared with placebo. Pooled rates were reported as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Eight RCT involving 3,287 patients (1873 CD and 1415 UC) were analyzed; 2,493 patients received vedolizumab and 794 received placebo. The rates of RTI and URTI were statistically higher in vedolizumab-treated patients compared to placebo [OR = 1.63; 95% CI (1.07-2.49); OR = 1.64 95% CI (1.07-2.53) respectively]. UC patients, but not CD patients, receiving vedolizumab had a higher risk to develop RTI and URTI [OR = 1.98; 95% CI (1.41-2.77); OR = 2.02; 95% CI (1.42-2.87)] compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of LRTI was small in both treatment groups. Data confirm the good safety profile of vedolizumab even though RTI were more frequent in patients receiving vedolizumab and the risk of URTIs was significantly higher in patients with UC.","Marafini, Irene; Troncone, Edoardo; Rocchetti, Irene; Monteleone, Giovanni",Frontiers in pharmacology,1663-9812,10.3389/fphar.2020.585732,33551798,"Chair of Gastroenterology, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Chair of Gastroenterology, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.; Statistical Office, Superior Council of Judiciary, Rome, Italy.; Chair of Gastroenterology, Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33551798,
Microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids do not interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection of human colonic samples.,2021,"Microbiota-derived molecules called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a key role in the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and regulation of immune response during infectious conditions. Recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection changes microbiota and SCFAs production. However, the relevance of this effect is unknown. In this study, we used human intestinal biopsies and intestinal epithelial cells to investigate the impact of SCFAs in the infection by SARS-CoV-2. SCFAs did not change the entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal cells. These metabolites had no effect on intestinal cells' permeability and presented only minor effects on the production of anti-viral and inflammatory mediators. Together our findings indicate that the changes in microbiota composition of patients with COVID-19 and, particularly, of SCFAs do not interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the intestine.","Pascoal, Lívia Bitencourt;

Management of inflammatory bowel disease in the COVID-19 era.,Jan 2022,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many unpredictable changes have occurred in the medical field. Risk of COVID-19 does not seem to increase in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) considering based on current reports. Current medications for IBD do not increase this risk; on the contrary, some of these might be used as therapeutics against COVID-19 and are under clinical trial. Unless the patients have confirmed COVID-19 and severe pneumonia or a high oxygen demand, medical treatment should be continued during the pandemic, except for the use of high-dose corticosteroids. Adherence to general recommendations such as social distancing, wearing facial masks, and vaccination, especially for pneumococcal infections and influenza, is also required. Patients with COVID-19 need to be withhold immunomodulators or biologics for at least 2 weeks and treated based on both IBD and COVID-19 severity. Prevention of IBD relapse caused by sudden medication interruption is important because negative outcomes associated with disease flare up, such as corticosteroid use or hospitalization, are much riskier than medications. The outpatient clinic and infusion center for biologics need to be reserved safe spaces, and endoscopy or surgery should be considered in urgent cases only.","Kim, Kyeong Ok; Jang, Byung Ik",Intestinal research,1598-9100,10.5217/ir.2020.00156,33525860,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33525860,

Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,Mar 2021,"The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age. Because the impact of immunosuppression on disease severity is not entirely clear, management of patients under immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial. Six cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive medication are presented. The aim of this study was to describe patients' clinical manifestation and chronologic development of virus-specific antibodies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection before and after restart with immunosuppressive/biological therapy as an indicator for a specific immune response. All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients. Late antibody development seems to be more frequent in older patients and in patients with combined immunosuppressive treatment. In this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could be useful prior to restarting immunosuppressive therapy.","Scharrer, Susanna; Kutschera, Maximilian; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Primas, Christian; Vogelsang, Harald",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,1473-5687,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002094,33522752,"Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna.; Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University of Vienna.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33522752,

In this position statement endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) section and IBD Clinical Research Group, we consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with IBD. The risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are anticipated to be very low, and we strongly support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IBD. Based on data from previous studies with other vaccines, there are conceptual concerns that protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with IBD, such as those taking anti-TNF drugs. However, the benefits of vaccination, even in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs, are likely to outweigh these theoretical concerns. Key areas for further research are discussed, including vaccine hesitancy and its effect in the IBD community, the effect of immunosuppression on vaccine efficacy, and the search for predictive biomarkers of vaccine success.","Alexander, James L; Moran, Gordon W; Gaya, Daniel R; Raine, Tim; Hart, Ailsa; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Lindsay, James O; MacDonald, Jonathan; Segal, Jonathan P; Sebastian, Shaji; Selinger, Christian P; Parkes, Miles; Smith, Philip J; Dhar, Anjan; Subramanian, Sreedhar; Arasaradnam, Ramesh; Lamb, Christopher A; Ahmad, Tariq; Lees, Charlie W; Dobson, Liz; Wakeman, Ruth; Iqbal, Tariq H; Arnott, Ian; Powell, Nick; ,",The lancet.

"[Mechanism and intervention of mucosal immune regulation based on ""lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related"" theory of traditional Chinese medicine].",Dec 2020,"The ""lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related"" is one of the classical theories in traditional Chinese medicine, which indicates a close correlation between the lung and large intestine in physiology and pathology, and plays a pivotal role in guiding the treatment of the lung and bowel diseases. Modern medicine has revealed some connections between the lung and large intestine in tissue origin and mucosal immunity, and preliminarily illuminated the material basis and possible regulatory mechanism of the theory. Recently, this theory has been applied to guide the treatment of refractory lung and intestine diseases such as COVID-19 and ulcerative colitis and has obtained reliable efficacy. Existing research results show that the anatomical homogeneity of lung and large intestine promotes the correlation between lung-bowel mucosal immunity, and mucosal immunity and migration and homing of innate lymphocytes are one of the physiological and pathological mechanisms for lung and large intestine to share. Under the guidance of this theory, Chinese medicines with heat-clearing and detoxifying or tonic effects are commonly used in the treatment of the lung and intestinal diseases by regulating lung-bowel mucosal immunity and they can be candidate drugs to treat lung/intestinal diseases simultaneously. However, the existing studies on immune regulation are mainly focused on the expression levels of sIgA and cytokines, as well as the changes in the number of immune cells such as innate lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. While the following aspects need further investigation: the airway/intestinal mucous hypersecretion, the functional changes of pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barrier immune cells, the dynamic process of lung/intestinal mucosal immune interaction, the intervention effect of local pulmonary/intestinal microecology, the correlation and biological basis between the heat-clearing and detoxifying effect and the tonic effect, and its regulation of pulmonary/intestinal mucosal immunity. In this paper, we try to analyze the internal relationship between lung and intestine related diseases from the point of view of the common mucosal immune system of lung and intestine, and summarize the characteristics and rules of traditional Chinese medicine compound and its active ingredients, which have regulatory effect on lung and intestine mucosal immune system, so as to further explain the theoretical connotation of ""lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related"" and provide reference for the research and development of drugs for related diseases.","Lou, Zhaohuan; Zhao, Huajun; Lyu, Guiyuan",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease Presenting With Concurrent COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome.,Apr 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a postinfectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). This syndrome is marked by cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction, often affecting the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, and the hematopoietic system. We describe the case of a 16-year-old boy with an initial presentation of severe inflammatory bowel disease and concurrent MIS-C. He presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia and met criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Laboratory inflammatory profiling revealed markedly elevated ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, soluble interleukin 2, and interleukin 6 levels. Endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed severe active gastroduodenitis, patchy colitis, and a normal-appearing terminal ileum. The patient was treated with a combination of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and infliximab, and his symptoms slowly resolved over a 3-week period.

[Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 in children].,Aug 2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a high environmental stable virus. It is predominantly a respiratory pathogen that also affects the gastrointestinal tract. The ACE 2 receptor is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, with evidence of its high presence in the intestine, colon and cholangiocytes, and, in smaller proportion, in hepatocytes. SARS-CoV-2 has a gastrointestinal tropism that explains digestive symptoms and viral spread in stools. The characteristics of this virus include the S (Spike) protein that binds very stably to the ACE-2 receptor and, at the same time, SARS-CoV-2 produces dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-lung axis. It produces a clear T-cell response and a cytokines storm in the intestine and liver that would produce inflammatory bowel damage. Intestinal manifestations by order of frequency are loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain, where the latter could be a severity marker. In children, diarrhea is the most frequent symptom, usually mild and self-limiting. In the liver, hypertransaminasemia occurs in severe patients ranging from 40 to 60%. SARS-CoV-2 can re main in stools longer than in respiratory secretions, which would influence the spread of disease. This article highlights the importance of an early diagnosis of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations, increase the index of suspicion, make a timely diagnosis, and recognize eventual complications of the disease. The potential oral-fecal route of transmission may influence the disease spread. Recognizing this finding is important to define isolation.","Villanueva Ch, Mónica; Faundez H, Rossana; Godoy, Marcela",Revista chilena de pediatria,0717-6228,10.32641/rchped.vi91i4.2484,33399743,"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.; Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile.; Hospital Clínico San Borja Arriarán, Santiago, Chile.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33399743,
Predicting Outcome in Acute Severe Colitis-Controversies in Clinical Practice in 2021.,Jul 2021,"Acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC] remains a common medical emergency, with 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis experiencing at least one event in their disease course. Despite advances in medical therapy, ASUC continues to be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, with up to 30% of patients requiring colectomy during initial admission. Our aim was to review the current controversies and recent progress in risk stratification, prediction of outcome, and personalisation of care in ASUC. We re-assess the use of Truelove and Witts' criteria, serum biomarkers, and the use of composite clinical indices in current clinical practice. We explore the potential for endoscopic prediction using defined validated indices for accurate and early prognostication, and the need to define outcome. We also consider the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we discuss the current research agenda, including the application of new and emerging biomarkers coupled with multi-omics and the implications in management and optimisation of outcome. Research priorities for the prediction of outcome in acute severe colitis include the following. 1. Development of an accurate admission score to guide early medical rescue therapy or colectomy. 2. Utility of point-of-care faecal calprotectin, with determination of optimal cut-off values. 3. Role of serum and faecal infliximab levels to both predict outcome and guide accelerated infliximab dosing. 4. Role of novel biomarkers, including serum calprotectin, in predicting response to corticosteroids or rescue therapy. 5. Specific predictors of response to ciclosporin and infliximab to allow rationalisation of drug use. 6. Utility of validated endoscopic scores. 7. Utility of radiological assessment beyond use of plain abdominal X-ray. 8.

Moreover, the following aspects pertaining to COVID-19 have also been discussed: transmission, resistance in the human body, the impact of nutritional status in relation to the intestinal microbiota, and the impact of comorbid metabolic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), obesity, and type two diabetes (T2D). The articles investigated show that health, age, and nutritional status are associated with specific communities of bacterial species in the gut, which could influence the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Patients suffering from metabolic and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are thought to be at a moderate-to-high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating the direct implication of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 severity. However, additional efforts are required to identify the initial GI symptoms of COVID-19 for possible early intervention.","Vodnar, Dan-Cristian; Mitrea, Laura; Teleky, Bernadette-Emoke; Szabo, Katalin; Călinoiu, Lavinia-Florina; Nemeş, Silvia-Amalia; Martău, Gheorghe-Adrian",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2235-2988,10.3389/fcimb.2020.575559,33363049,"Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Faculty of Food Science and Technology, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Faculty of Food Science and Technology, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Institute of Life Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Faculty of Food Science and Technology, University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33363049,

Cell-Type-Specific Immune Dysregulation in Severely Ill COVID-19 Patients.,Jan 2021,"Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy (n = 3) and COVID-19 patients with moderate disease (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n = 6), or recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data reveal transcriptomic profiles indicative of defective antigen presentation and interferon (IFN) responsiveness in monocytes from ARDS patients, which contrasts with higher responsiveness to IFN signaling in lymphocytes. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxic activity are suppressed in both natural killer (NK) and CD8 T lymphocytes, and B cell activation is deficient, which is consistent with delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have a state of immune imbalance in which dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses may be contributing to a more severe disease course.","Yao, Changfu; Bora, Stephanie A; Parimon, Tanyalak; Zaman, Tanzira; Friedman, Oren A; Palatinus, Joseph A; Surapaneni, Nirmala S; Matusov, Yuri P; Cerro Chiang, Giuliana; Kassar, Alexander G; Patel, Nayan; Green, Chelsi E R; Aziz, Adam W; Suri, Harshpreet; Suda, Jo; Lopez, Andres A; Martins, Gislâine A; Stripp, Barry R; Gharib, Sina A; Goodridge, Helen S; Chen, Peter",Cell reports,2211-1247,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108590,33357411,"Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Research Division of Immunology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Research Division of Immunology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Research Division of Immunology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA; F.

The persistence of interleukin-6 is regulated by a blood buffer system derived from dendritic cells.,Feb 2021,"The interleukin-6 (IL-6) membrane receptor and its circulating soluble form, sIL-6R, can be targeted by antibody therapy to reduce deleterious immune signaling caused by chronic overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. This strategy may also hold promise for treating acute hyperinflammation, such as observed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting a need to define regulators of IL-6 homeostasis. We found that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), defined in mice via expression of the transcription factor Zbtb46, were a major source of circulating sIL-6R and, thus, systemically regulated IL-6 signaling. This was uncovered through identification of a cDC-dependent but T cell-independent modality that naturally adjuvants plasma cell differentiation and antibody responses to protein antigens. This pathway was then revealed as part of a broader biological buffer system in which cDC-derived sIL-6R set the in-solution persistence of IL-6. This control axis may further inform the development of therapeutic agents to modulate pro-inflammatory immune reactions.","Yousif, Ashraf S; Ronsard, Larance; Shah, Pankaj; Omatsu, Tatsushi; Sangesland, Maya; Bracamonte Moreno, Thalia; Lam, Evan C; Vrbanac, Vladimir D; Balazs, Alejandro B; Reinecker, Hans-Christian; Lingwood, Daniel",Immunity,1097-4180,10.1016/j.immuni.2020.12.001,33357409,"The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; The Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; The Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA; The Center for the Genetics of Host Defense, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX 75390, USA.; The Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

COVID-19 Infection in a Child Presenting With Functional Intestinal Obstruction.,Nov 2020,"This report describes the case of a 13-year-old male patient presenting with functional small bowel obstruction. The child was also observed to have persistent tachycardia, and repeat cardiac examination revealed a new-onset cardiac murmur and a gallop rhythm. Acute viral myocarditis was clinically suspected, prompting further cardiac evaluations including electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (echo), and cardiac enzyme panel. Both EKG and echo findings suggested acute myocardial injury, in addition to elevated levels of cardiac enzymes and other inflammatory markers. Considering the ongoing pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was suspected, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Because multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may occur later in the course of COVID-19 illness, a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was performed, with positive results.

NLR in eXile: Emerging roles of NLRX1 in immunity and human disease.,Mar 2021,"NLRX1 is a member of the NOD-like receptor family, a set of pattern recognition receptors associated with innate immunity. Interestingly, NLRX1 exists in somewhat of an exile from its NLR counterparts with unique features that mediate atypical functions compared with traditional NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Aside from a mitochondrial targeting sequence, the N-terminal region is yet to be characterized. Mitochondrially located, NLRX1 sits within a subgroup of regulatory NLRs responsible for negatively regulating cellular inflammatory signalling. As well as modulating pathogen response, emerging evidence is implicating NLRX1 as a central homeostatic gatekeeper between mitochondrial biology and immunological response. More recently, NLRX1 has been implicated in a wide range of disease, both pathogen-driven and otherwise. Emerging links of NLRX1 in cancer biology, autoimmunity and other inflammatory conditions are raising the potential of targeting NLRX1 therapeutically, with recent studies in inflammatory bowel disease showing great promise. Within this review, we address the unique features of NLRX1, its roles in innate immune signalling and its involvement in a range of inflammatory, metabolic and oncology disease indications with a focus on areas that could benefit from therapeutic targeting of NLRX1.","Pickering, Robert J; Booty, Lee M",Immunology,1365-2567,10.1111/imm.13291,33314068,"Immunology Network, Adaptive Immunity Research Unit, GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK.; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.; Immunology Network, Adaptive Immunity Research Unit, GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314068,

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of health care workers.,Jan 2021,"BACKGROUNDSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The antituberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates nonspecific, protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a longitudinal, retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs).METHODSWe assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, which included information on BCG vaccination status and preexisting demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multisite Los Angeles health care organization. We used multivariate analysis to determine whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion.RESULTSOf the 6201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination, whereas 68.9% had not received BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as the incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were markedly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared with those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that a history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal, or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion.CONCLUSIONSA history of BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease in the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a lower number of participants who self-reported experiencing COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized, prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm whether BCG vaccination can confer a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rivas, Magali Noval; Ebinger, Joseph E; Wu, Min; Sun, Nancy; Braun, Jonathan; Sobhani, Kimia; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Cheng, Susan; Arditi, Moshe",The Journal of clinical investigation,1558-8238,10.1172/JCI145157,33211672,"Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Infectious and Immunologic Diseases Research Center (IIDRC), and Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Cardiology.; Smidt Heart Institute.; Department of Cardiology.; Smidt Heart Institute.; Department of Cardiology.; Smidt Heart Institute.; F.

SARS-CoV-2 microbiome dysbiosis linked disorders and possible probiotics role.,Jan 2021,"In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown etiology was reported which caused panic in Wuhan city of central China, which was later identified as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 spread has already become a global pandemic with a considerable death toll. The associated symptoms of the COVID-19 infection varied with increased inflammation as an everyday pathological basis. Among various other symptoms such as fever, cough, lethargy, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms included diarrhea and IBD with colitis, have been reported. Currently, there is no sole cure for COVID-19, and researchers are actively engaged to search out appropriate treatment and develop a vaccine for its prevention. Antiviral for controlling viral load and corticosteroid therapy for reducing inflammation seems to be inadequate to control the fatality rate. Based on the available related literature, which documented GI symptoms with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with colitis, and increased deaths in the intensive care unit (ICU), conclude that dysbiosis occurs during SARS-COV-2 infection as the gut-lung axis cannot be ignored. As probiotics play a therapeutic role for GI, IBD, colitis, and even in viral infection. So, we assume that the inclusion of studies to investigate gut microbiome and subsequent therapies such as probiotics might help decrease the inflammatory response of viral pathogenesis and respiratory symptoms by strengthening the host immune system, amelioration of gut microbiome, and improvement of gut barrier function.","Din, Ahmad Ud; Mazhar, Maryam; Waseem, Muhammed; Ahmad, Waqar; Bibi, Asma; Hassan, Adil; Ali, Niaz; Gang, Wang; Qian, Gao; Ullah, Razi; Shah, Tariq; Ullah, Mehraj; Khan, Israr; Nisar, Muhammad Farrukh; Wu, Jianbo",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,1950-6007,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110947,33197765,"Drug Discovery Research Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, 646000, Sichuan, China.; Research Center of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Affiliated Traditional Medicine Hospital, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Horticulture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.; Drug Discovery Research Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, 646000, Sichuan, China; College of Marine Life Sciences and Institute of Evolution and Marine Biodiversity, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, China.; Institute of Zoonosis Anhui Medical University, Hefei Anhui, 230032, China.; Key Laboratory for Bio-rheological Science and Technology of Ministry of Education, State and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Vascular Implants Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, China.; State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bio-resources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, 530004, Guangxi, China.; Drug Discovery Research Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, 646000, Sichuan, China.; Drug Discovery Research Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, 646000, Sichuan, China.; Key Laboratory for Bio-rheological Science and Technology of Ministry of Education, State and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Vascular Implants Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, China.; State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.; Department of Biotechnology School of Fermentation Engineering Tianjin University of Science and Technology China, China.; School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, China.; Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (CUVAS), Bahawalpur, 63100, Pakistan.; Drug Discovery Research Center, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, 646000, Sichuan, China.

Management of Patients with Inflammatory Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Sep 2020,"Patients with various inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, liver, kidneys, and musculoskeletal system-connective tissues, often undergo different anti-inflammatory therapies to maintain remission and avoid serious and/or life-threatening complications. Available data so far show an increased rate of hospitalization in such patients during the COVID19 pandemic. The key points of our position statement are summarized below: Patients with inflammatory diseases who receive moderate or high-risk anti-inflammatory therapies might be considered as an increased risk group for severe COVID-19 and appropriate measures should be taken in order to protect them. Initiation of immuno-suppressive/modulatory therapies should be done with caution, taking into account the severity of the underlying inflammatory disease, the type of anti-inflammatory treatment, and the risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Discontinuation of anti-inflammatory therapies in patients who have not been exposed to or infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not recommended. In patients who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, anti-inflammatory therapies should be discontinued, except in special cases. Specialty physicians should actively participate in the Interdisciplinary Teams caring for patients with inflammatory diseases during COVID19 infection.","Apostolou, Theofanis; Koutroubakis, Ioannis E; Manolakopoulos, Spilios; Mantzaris, Gerasimos; Rigopoulos, Dimitrios; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos; Vassilopoulos, Dimitrios",Mediterranean journal of rheumatology,2529-198X,10.31138/mjr.31.3.295,33196008,"President of the Hellenic Nephrological Society (HNS).; President and Board Member of the Hellenic Study Group for Inflammatory Bowel, Diseases (EOMIFNE).; President of the Hellenic Society for the Study of Liver (HASL).; President and Board Member of the Hellenic Study Group for Inflammatory Bowel, Diseases (EOMIFNE).; President of the Hellenic Society of Dermatology and Venereology (HSDV).; President of the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology (HSG).; President of the Greek Rheumatology Society & Professional Association of Rheumatologists (EPE-EPERE).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33196008,

"Inflammatory bowel disease amid the COVID-19 pandemic: impact, management strategies, and lessons learned.",2020,"The current outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected nearly 188 countries. Patients with severe COVID-19 are more commonly elderly and suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, and cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects as many as 6.8 million people globally, and a significant proportion of them are treated with immunosuppressants. Hence, there is an ongoing concern over the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients and their susceptibility to it. So far, there are about 1439 IBD patients in the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD) registry reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. There are many unique challenges and dilemmas that need to be taken into account when managing an IBD patient with COVID-19. The management of each patient should be individualized. The IBD societies and experts have strongly recommended that patients should not discontinue their IBD medications. If the patients have symptoms of COVID-19 or IBD flare-up, they are recommended to call their IBD physician first to discuss their medication. In addition, IBD patients are urged to practice social distancing strictly to minimize the chances of infection. As COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, our experience and understanding of its impact on the IBD population may potentially change in the near future.","Gajendran, Mahesh; Perisetti, Abhilash; Aziz, Muhammad; Raghavapuram, Saikiran; Bansal, Pardeep; Tharian, Benjamin; Goyal, Hemant",Annals of gastroenterology,1108-7471,10.20524/aog.2020.0547,33162736,"Paul L.

De-escalation of medical therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.,Dec 2020,"Treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) now increasingly target deep remission, yet the resultant more aggressive use of medical therapy is associated with potentially serious adverse events and significant costs. It is, therefore, of vital importance to consider when, how and in whom medical therapy may be safely de-escalated. This issue is of great potential relevance in the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. In this review, we first discuss the rationale for drug withdrawal in IBD, before considering the available data on withdrawal of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), immunomodulators (IM) and biological therapy in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). We consider how to identify patients most appropriate for drug withdrawal and outline a potential monitoring strategy for the early detection of relapse following drug withdrawal. We conclude with important future perspectives in this challenging field, and highlight ongoing trials that are likely to shape practice in the years to come.","Frias Gomes, Catarina; Chapman, Thomas P; Satsangi, Jack",Current opinion in pharmacology,1471-4973,10.1016/j.coph.2020.09.014,33160250,"Surgical Department, Gastroenterology Division, Hospital Beatriz Ângelo, Loures, Portugal.

A network medicine approach to investigation and population-based validation of disease manifestations and drug repurposing for COVID-19.,Nov 2020,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Mehra, Reena; Kallianpur, Asha; Culver, Daniel A; Gack, Michaela U; Farha, Samar; Zein, Joe; Comhair, Suzy; Fiocchi, Claudio; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus; Chan, Timothy; Eng, Charis; Jung, Jae U; Jehi, Lara; Erzurum, Serpil; Cheng, Feixiong",PLoS biology,1545-7885,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000970,33156843,"Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Florida Research and Innovation Center, Cleveland Clinic, Port Saint Lucie, Florida, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33156843,

Improving Hepatitis B Virus Vaccination Responses in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Does Greater Dose and Greater Frequency Lead to Greater Protection?,Nov 2020,"Prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) infection is particularly important for patients with inflammatory bowel disease because of risks of HBV reactivation on immunosuppressive therapies. However, immune responses to standard HBV vaccination regimens are suboptimal. Chaparro et al. compared immune responses to 2 vaccines, an adjuvanted HBV vaccine (Fendrix) and double-dosed standard vaccine (Engerix-B) using an accelerated, 4-dose regimen (0, 1, 2, and 6 months). Although the study did not demonstrate superiority of one vaccine over another, several lessons can be derived regarding immune response to vaccinations among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including the need to consider nonstandard regimens for patients on immunosuppression. These lessons can be translated broadly, including to a potential future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine when one becomes available.","Banty, Andrea; Melmed, Gil Y",The American journal of gastroenterology,1572-0241,10.14309/ajg.0000000000000921,33156097,"Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33156097,

As the outbreak appears to be in the descending phase, at least in some part of the world, as in most European countries, guidance is urgently needed to provide optimal care for our IBD patients in order to gradually and safely reduce the gap in care that has been accumulated in the months of lockdown and to face all the backlogs. Therefore, we have provided a decalogue of practical recommendations for gastroenterologists to manage patients with IBD in the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Not at Increased Risk of COVID-19: A Large Multinational Cohort Study.,Oct 2020,"The impact of COVID-19 on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients under pharmacological immunosuppression is still not clearly understood. We investigated the incidence of COVID-19 and the impact of immunosuppression and containment measures on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large IBD cohort, from a multicenter cohort from 21st of February to 30th of June, 2020. Ninety-seven patients with IBD (43 UC, 53 CD, one unclassified IBD) and concomitant COVID-19 over a total of 23,879 patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD vs. the general population was 0.406% and 0.402% cases, respectively. Twenty-three patients (24%) were hospitalized, 21 (22%) had pneumonia, four (4%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and one patient died. Lethality in our cohort was 1% compared to 9% in the general population. At multivariable analysis, age > 65 years was associated with increased risk of pneumonia and hospitalization (OR 11.6, 95% CI 2.18-62.60; OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.10-23.86, respectively), treatment with corticosteroids increased the risk of hospitalization (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.48-40.05), whereas monoclonal antibodies were associated with reduced risk of pneumonia and hospitalization (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04-0.52; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, respectively). The risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD is similar to the general population. National lockdown was effective in preventing infection in our cohort. Advanced age and treatment with corticosteroids impacted negatively on the outcome of COVID-19, whereas monoclonal antibodies did not seem to have a detrimental effect.","Allocca, Mariangela; Chaparro, María; Gonzalez, Haidee Aleman; Bosca-Watts, Marta Maia; Palmela, Carolina; D'Amico, Ferdinando; Zacharopoulou, Eirini; Kopylov, Uri; Ellul, Pierre; Bamias, Giorgos; Ntelis, Vassilios; Lahat, Adi; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J; Papaconstantinou, Ioannis; Katsanos, Konstantinos; Uspenskaya, Yulia; Christodoulou, Dimitrios; Ben Horin, Shomron; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Torres, Joanna; Sebastian, Shaji; Gisbert, Javier P; Danese, Silvio; Fiorino, Gionata",Journal of clinical medicine,2077-0383,10.3390/jcm9113533,33142843,"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS-, via Manzoni 56, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20090 Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Princesa (IIS-IP), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD), 28001 Madrid, Spain.; IBD Unit, Hull University Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull HU1, UK.; IBD Unit, Digestive Disease Department, University of Valencia, University Clinic Hospital of Valencia, 46010 València, Spain.; Division of Gastroenterology, Hospital Beatriz Ângelo, 2620 Loures, Portugal.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20090 Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy.; Department of Gastroenterology, Inserm U1256 NGERE, Nancy University Hospital, Lorraine University, 54500 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS-, via Manzoni 56, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Gastroenterology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Jaffa 59623, Israel.; Division of Gastroenterology, Mater Dei Hospital, MT-34 Msida, Malta.; GI-Unit, 3rd Academic Department of Internal Medicine, Sotiria Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 210 Athens, Greece.; G.Gennimatas General Hospital, 210 Athens, Greece.; Department of Gastroenterology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Jaffa 59623, Israel.; Department of Gastroenterology, GHA Evaggelismos-Ophthalmiatreion Athinon-Polykliniki, 210 Athens, Greece.; 2nd Academic Department of Surgery, Aretaieion Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 210 Athens, Greece.; Division of Gastroenterology, University Hospital and University of Ioannina, 440 Ioannina, Greece.; Medical Center ""Ne Bolit"" LTT, Leninsky Prospect, 66 Moscow, Russia.; Division of Gastroenterology, University Hospital and University of Ioannina, 440 Ioannina, Greece.; Department of Gastroenterology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Jaffa 59623, Israel.; Department of Gastroenterology, Inserm U1256 NGERE, Nancy University Hospital, Lorraine University, 54500 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.; Division of Gastroenterology, Hospital Beatriz Ângelo, 2620 Loures, Portugal.; IBD Unit, Hull University Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull HU1, UK.; Gastroenterology Unit, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Princesa (IIS-IP), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD), 28001 Madrid, Spain.; Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS-, via Manzoni 56, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20090 Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20090 Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33142843,
ACE2 and gut amino acid transport.,Nov 2020,"ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with extracellular carboxypeptidase activity displaying a broad tissue distribution with highest expression levels at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestine enterocytes and a lower expression in stomach and colon. In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. These heterodimers can form quaternary structures able to function as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. B0AT1 mutations cause Hartnup disorder, a condition characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and, in some cases, pellagra-like symptoms, such as photosensitive rash, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia. Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.","Camargo, Simone M R; Vuille-Dit-Bille, Raphael N; Meier, Chantal F; Verrey, François","Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",1470-8736,10.1042/CS20200477,33140827,"Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Children's Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; NCCR Kidney.CH, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33140827,

Gaining insight into the functions of ACE2 in gut homeostasis therefore merits closer examination, and is beneficial to find potential therapeutic alternatives for COVID-19.","Yu, Wei; Ou, Xianhong; Liu, Xiaofan; Zhang, Shuaixu; Gao, Xinxin; Cheng, Hongju; Zhu, Baoliang; Yan, Jing",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1090-2104,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.002,33097186,"Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Electrophysiology of Ministry of Education and Medical Electrophysiological Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.; Department of Physiology, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, 272067, PR China.

Patient perspectives on social-media-delivered telemedicine for inflammatory bowel disease.,Oct 2020,"In attempts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among high-risk inflammatory bowel disease patients, many gastroenterology practices have recently gone 'virtual', using telemedicine technologies to care for their patients. In efforts to support this transition and improve approachability, social media platforms have been used to deliver telemedicine services with significant success. However, the patient perspective on this use of social media has largely been ignored. This study provides a baseline patient perspective on social media usage to help inform clinicians on which methods of telemedicine delivery will be best suited to their patient populations.","O'Neill, Parker; Shandro, Benjamin; Poullis, Andrew",Future healthcare journal,2514-6645,10.7861/fhj.2020-0094,33094237,"St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094237,

Review of inflammatory bowel disease and COVID-19.,Oct 2020,"The first cases of a novel corona virus infection were reported in Wuhan China in December of 2019, followed by the declaration of an international pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Early reports of the virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and its clinical disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has shown higher rates of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. Of particular concern is the safety of those with compromised immune systems. Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) is itself caused by a disordered immune response, with the most effective medical therapies being immune suppressing or modifying. As such, the risk of COVID-19, virus related outcomes, and appropriate management of IBD patients during the global pandemic is of immediate concern to gastroenterologists worldwide. There has been a rapid accumulation of clinical data and expert opinion on the topic. This review will highlight the latest source information on clinical observation/outcomes of the IBD population and provide a concise summary of the most up to date perspectives on IBD management in the age of COVID-19.","Sultan, Keith; Mone, Anjali; Durbin, Laura; Khuwaja, Samreen; Swaminath, Arun",World journal of gastroenterology,2219-2840,10.3748/wjg.v26.i37.5534,33088153,"Division of Gastroenterology, Northwell Health, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Great Neck, NY 10021, United States.; Department of Gastroenterology, Northwell Health, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 10075, United States.; Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 10075, United States.; Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Long Island Jewish Forest Hills Hospital, Queens, NY 11375, United States. ksultan@northwell.edu.; Division of Gastroenterology, Northwell Health, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 10075, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33088153,
"COVID-19 Pandemic: Which IBD Patients Need to Be Scoped-Who Gets Scoped Now, Who Can Wait, and how to Resume to Normal.",Oct 2020,"Endoscopy is an essential component in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. There is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during endoscopic procedures. The International Organization for the study of IBD [IOIBD] has developed 11 position statements, based on an online survey, that focus on how to prioritise endoscopies in IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative modes for disease monitoring, and ways to triage the high number of postponed endoscopies after the pandemic. We propose to pre-screen patients for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and test for SARS-CoV-2 before endoscopy if available. High priority endoscopies during pandemic include acute gastrointestinal bleed, acute severe ulcerative colitis, new IBD diagnosis, cholangitis in primary sclerosing cholangitis, and partial bowel obstruction. Alternative modes of monitoring using clinical symptoms, serum inflammatory markers, and faecal calprotectin should be considered during the pandemic. Prioritising access to endoscopy in the post-pandemic period should be guided by control of COVID-19 in the local community and availability of manpower and personal protective equipment. Endoscopy should be considered within 3 months after the pandemic for patients with a past history of dysplasia and endoscopic resection for dysplastic lesion. Endoscopy should be considered 3-6 months after the pandemic for assessment of postoperative recurrence or new biologic initiation. Endoscopy can be postponed until after 6 months of pandemic for routine IBD surveillance and assessment of mucosal healing.","Ng, Siew C; Mak, Joyce Wing Yan; Hitz, Lara; Chowers, Yehuda; Bernstein, Charles N; Silverberg, Mark S",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa128,33085973,"aInstitute of Digestive Disease, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, LKS Institute of Health Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; aInstitute of Digestive Disease, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, LKS Institute of Health Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; bMount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; cDepartment of Gastroenterology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.; dUniversity of Manitoba, Manitoba Winnipeg Canada.; bMount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33085973,
Guidance for Restarting Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy in Patients Who Withheld Immunosuppressant Medications During COVID-19.,Oct 2020,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] are frequently treated with immunosuppressant medications. During the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic, recommendations for IBD management have included that patients should stay on their immunosuppressant medications if they are not infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], but to temporarily hold these medications if symptomatic with COVID-19 or asymptomatic but have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. As more IBD patients are infected globally, it is important to also understand how to manage IBD medications during convalescence while an individual with IBD is recovering from COVID-19. In this review, we address the differences between a test-based versus a symptoms-based strategy as related to COVID-19, and offer recommendations on when it is appropriate to consider restarting IBD therapy in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19. In general, we recommend a symptoms-based approach, due to the current lack of confidence in the accuracy of available testing and the clinical significance of prolonged detection of virus via molecular testing.","Siegel, Corey A; Christensen, Britt; Kornbluth, Asher; Rosh, Joel R; Kappelman, Michael D; Ungaro, Ryan C; Johnson, Douglas Forsyth; Chapman, Scott; Wohl, David A; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa135,33085972,"Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock IBD Center, Lebanon, NH, USA.; Gastroenterology Department, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Henry D.

Management of Pregnant Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Oct 2020,The rapid emergence of the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV2] and the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] has caused significant global morbidity and mortality. This is particularly concerning for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Care for pregnant IBD patients in itself is a complex issue because of the delicate balance between controlling maternal IBD as well as promoting the health of the unborn child. This often requires continued immunosuppressive maintenance medication or the introduction of new IBD medication during pregnancy.

Why Do Immunosuppressed Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Not Seem to Be at a Higher Risk of COVID-19?,Sep 2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health emergency. In this context, there are major concerns for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly for those treated with immunomodulators, biologics, and Janus Kinase inhibitors. Infection susceptibility is, in fact, one of the reported risks for immunotherapy drugs. This review provides the existing evidence from worldwide case series describing: (a) the risk for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the risk of a severe infection outcome in patients with IBD treated with immunotherapy. Further, the review discusses the potential mechanisms underlying why this group of patients with IBD might be protected from contracting the infection and from a worse disease. From the available data, it appears that these patients should have an enhanced adherence to the recommended preventive measures, suggesting a role in reducing their risk of infection. Furthermore, the immunotherapy may dampen the cytokine storm and inflammation associated with COVID-19. The results of this review seem to confirm that patients with IBD receiving immunomodulators, biologics, or Janus Kinase inhibitors do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe COVID-19. According to the current evidence, it is advisable to maintain immunotherapy, apart from corticosteroids, in patients with IBD in order to avoid relapse. This review reports only on the cases of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. This is a limitation and a more accurate epidemiological picture of the infection will be obtained only via the expanded use of antibody tests.","Scribano, Maria Lia",Digestive diseases and sciences,1573-2568,10.1007/s10620-020-06624-5,33073335,"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Circonvallazione Gianicolense, 87, 00152, Rome, Italy. marialiascribano@virgilio.it.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33073335,

"Unraveling the Role of ACE2, the Binding Receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",Nov 2020,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been highlighted for its role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes current knowledge about ACE2 as a multifunctional protein, focusing on its relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As an enzyme, ACE2 may be protective in IBD because it favors the counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system or deleterious because it metabolizes other anti-inflammatory/repairing elements. Meanwhile, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the impact of ACE2 expression/activity on infection is still under debate because no direct evidence has been reported and, again, both protective and deleterious pathways are possible. Research has shown that ACE2 regulates the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, controlling tryptophan-associated intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. Finally, intact membrane-bound or shed soluble ACE2 can also trigger integrin signaling, modulating the response to anti-integrin biologic drugs used to treat IBD (such as vedolizumab) and fibrosis, a long-term complication of IBD. As such, future studies on ACE2 expression/activity in IBD can improve monitoring of the disease and explore an alternative pharmacological target.","Ferreira-Duarte, Mariana; Estevinho, Maria Manuela; Duarte-Araújo, Margarida; Magro, Fernando; Morato, Manuela",Inflammatory bowel diseases,1536-4844,10.1093/ibd/izaa249,33064147,"Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Drug Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; LAQV@REQUIMTE, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Gastroenterology, Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho, Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal.; LAQV@REQUIMTE, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Immuno-Physiology and Pharmacology, ICBAS-UP, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Gastroenterology, Centro Hospitalar São João, Porto, Portugal.; MedInUP, Center for Drug Discovery and Innovative Medicines, Porto, Portugal.; Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Drug Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; LAQV@REQUIMTE, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064147,

In 2006, six healthy volunteers received TGN1412, a CD28 superagonist antibody, in a first-in-man clinical trial and suffered from cytokine storm. After the initial cytokine release, antibody effect-specific immune monitoring started on Day + 10 and consisted mainly of evaluation of dendritic cell and T-cell subsets and 15 serum cytokines at 21 time-points over 2 years. All patients developed problems with concentration and memory; three patients were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Mild neutropenia and autoantibody production was observed intermittently. One patient suffered from peripheral dry gangrene, required amputations, and had persistent Raynaud's phenomenon. Gastrointestinal irritability was noted in three patients and coincided with elevated γδT-cells. One had pruritus associated with elevated IgE levels, also found in three other asymptomatic patients. Dendritic cells, initially undetectable, rose to normal within a month.

The four epidemiological stages in the global evolution of inflammatory bowel disease.,Jan 2021,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a global disease; its evolution can be stratified into four epidemiological stages: Emergence, Acceleration in Incidence, Compounding Prevalence and Prevalence Equilibrium. In 2020, developing countries are in the Emergence stage, newly industrialized countries are in the Acceleration in Incidence stage, and Western regions are in the Compounding Prevalence stage. Western regions will eventually transition to the Prevalence Equilibrium stage, in which the accelerating prevalence levels off as the IBD population ages and possibly as a result of an unexpected rise in mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitigating the global burden of IBD will require concerted efforts in disease prevention and health-care delivery innovations that respond to changing demographics of the global IBD population. In this Perspective, we summarize the global epidemiology of IBD and use these data to stratify disease evolution into four epidemiological stages.","Kaplan, Gilaad G; Windsor, Joseph W",Nature reviews.

A Canadian perspective on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and treatment: how prevalent underlying inflammatory disease contributes to pathogenesis.,Apr 2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a serious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a global pandemic. Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 on the 25th January 2020. By March 2020, the virus had spread within Canadian communities reaching the most frail and vulnerable elderly population in long-term care facilities. The majority of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, and the highest mortality was seen among individuals aged 65 years or older. Canada has the highest prevalence and incidence rates of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease. Many elderly Canadians also live with comorbid medical illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease, and are more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that underlying inflammatory disease contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the host inflammatory responses that lead to resolution or progression to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss the landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics that are currently in development in Canada.","Willows, Steven; Alam, Syed Benazir; Sandhu, Jagdeep K; Kulka, Marianna",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,1208-6002,10.1139/bcb-2020-0341,33027600,"Nanotechnology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, AB T6G 2A3, Canada.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Nanotechnology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, AB T6G 2A3, Canada.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.; Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 1200 Montreal Road, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, 451 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada.; Nanotechnology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, AB T6G 2A3, Canada.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33027600,
Gastrointestinal insights during the COVID-19 epidemic.,Sep 2020,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has so far caused hundreds of mortalities worldwide. Although respiratory symptoms are the main complication in COVID-19 patients, the disease is also associated with gastrointestinal problems, with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting being primary COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, stool viral tests, and virus exposure are major concerns in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In patients with colorectal cancer and IBD, the colonic mucosa exhibits elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor levels, enhancing COVID-19 susceptibility. In some cases, positive viral stool tests may be the only indicator of infection at admission or after leaving quarantine. Without supplemental stool tests, the risk of undetected COVID-19 transmission is high. Moreover, viral exposure during the regular or emergency endoscopic examination should be avoided. We carefully discuss key gastrointestinal concerns with regard to COVID-19 and call for more attention to such problems.","Nie, Kai; Yang, Yuan-Yuan; Deng, Min-Zi; Wang, Xiao-Yan",World journal of clinical cases,2307-8960,10.12998/wjcc.v8.i18.3934,33024750,"Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410000, Hunan Province, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410000, Hunan Province, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410000, Hunan Province, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410000, Hunan Province, China. wxy220011@163.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33024750,

Remote Monitoring Empowerment of Patients with IBDs during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,Oct 2020,"Once the WHO declared the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, the world had to reprogram numerous clinical activities, particularly those related to highly disabling diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In this study, 1083 IBD patients were assessed, affected by Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and subdivided into two groups. The first group included patients who needed treatment in person at the outpatients clinic, while the second group could be tele-monitored because they were able to self-administer therapy. The tele-monitoring was based on telecommunication applications via smartphone, driven by a dedicated clinical control room in the IBD Clinic. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (using IBDQ32) of UC patients and tele-monitored CD patients (tele-monitoring group) as compared to those patients who underwent assessment in person in the outpatients clinic (control group). Despite observing a lower number of relapses in the control group than the tele-monitoring group, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of the IBD32Q scores. Tele-monitoring of patients who are able to self-administer the IBD therapy can be an effective vicarious system as compared to the clinical evaluation in person, that could lead to important changes to avoid the overcrowding of the IBD outpatients clinic, especially during public health crises like the present pandemic.","Mastronardi, Mauro; Curlo, Margherita; Polignano, Maurizio; Vena, Natalino; Rossi, Daniela; Giannelli, Gianluigi","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2227-9032,10.3390/healthcare8040377,33019563,"National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.; National Institute of Gastroenterology, ""Saverio de Bellis"" Research Hospital, 70013 Castellana Grotte, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33019563,

Mild COVID-19 Symptoms in an Infliximab-Treated Ulcerative Colitis Patient: Can Ongoing Anti-TNF Therapy Protect against the Viral Hyperinflammatory Response and Avoid Aggravated Outcomes?,Aug 2020,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, represents a potentially major challenge to patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who are treated with immunomodulatory therapies. We report the case of an 18-year-old ulcerative colitis patient in sustained clinical remission who 4 days after application of her ongoing therapy with the anti-TNF antibody infliximab developed mild respiratory and abdominal symptoms. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 but did not need hospitalization. The clinical symptoms completely resolved within 1 week after onset and there was no change in ulcerative colitis activity. The recently applied anti-TNF therapy did not lead to exacerbation of the infectious symptoms. Current recommendations strongly favor continuation of effective maintenance anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory bowel disease patients, as there is no evidence for aggravated CO-VID-19 upon infection. It is unclear whether anti-TNF treatment might even have assisted in preventing worsening of COVID-19 and improving outcome. Further data in the group of immune-mediated inflammatory disease patients under anti-TNF therapy are urgently needed.","Abdullah, Abdullah; Neurath, Markus F; Atreya, Raja",Visceral medicine,2297-4725,10.1159/000508740,32999889,"Department of Medicine 1, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.; Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.; Department of Medicine 1, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.; Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.; Department of Medicine 1, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.; Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999889,
Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated With SARS-CoV-2 [PIMS-TS] in a Patient Receiving Infliximab Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,Apr 2021,"Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 [PIMS-TS] is a newly described condition. It has a spectrum of presentations proposed to occur as part of a post-infectious immune response. We report the first case of PIMS-TS in a child on established anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNFα] therapy; a 10 year-old girl with ulcerative colitis treated with infliximab. The patient had 6 weeks of daily fever with mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal, renal, and haematological involvement. Biomarkers of hyperinflammation were present including: hyperferritinaemia [up to 691 µ/L; normal 15-80 µg/L], C-reactive protein [CRP] [ >100mg/L for  >10 days, normal 0-5 mg/L], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] consistently  >100mm/h [normal 0-15 mm/h], raised white cell count with neutrophilia, elevated D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], anaemia and Mott cells on bone marrow analysis. Extensive investigations for alternative diagnoses for pyrexia of unknown origin [PUO] were negative. The condition was refractory to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] but improved within 24 h of high-dose methylprednisolone. Infliximab treatment followed and the patient has remained well at follow-up. Polymerase chain reaction [PCR] and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Current series report such negative findings in up to half of cases. The patient experienced a milder clinical phenotype without cardiac involvement, shock, or organ failure. Accepting the wide spectrum of PIMS-TS presentations, it is possible that previous anti-TNFα therapy may have attenuated the disease course.

Presenting GI symptoms are seen in the majority, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Under the auspices of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IOIBD], a task force [TF] was formed, an online survey was developed to query infusion centre protocols during COVID-19, and recommendations were made, based on TF experience and opinion. Recommendations focus mainly on patients screening, infusion centres re-organization, personnel protection, and protocol modifications such as shortening infusion duration or replacing it with subcutaneous alternatives. Implementing these recommendations will hopefully reduce exposure of both IBD patients and care givers to SARS-COV-2 and improve the function and safety of infusion centres during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as potential future threats.","Dotan, Iris; Panaccione, Remo; Kaplan, Gilaad G; O'Morain, Colm; Lindsay, James O; Abreu, Maria T",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa147,32959882,"Division of Gastroenterology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel and the Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; Research and Welness Building, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; National Lead in Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Beacon Hospital, Sandyford, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.; Crohn's and Colitis Center, Professor of Medicine, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32959882,

Immunomodulatory Drugs in the Management of SARS-CoV-2.,2020,"With the onset of the global pandemic in 2020 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), there has been increasing research activity around certain disease-modifying drugs that are used for the management of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthrosis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease for managing coronavirus symptoms. In the conditions mentioned, many people are on long-term treatment with agents including hydroxychloroquine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitor drugs, other biologic agents such as monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and Janus kinase inhibitors including baricitinib and tofacitinib, which are used to control inflammatory responses in their respective auto-immune condition. There is emerging data that immunomodulatory drugs could be protective at reducing certain features of SARS-CoV-2 and improving recovery. In addition, it is important to understand if subjects being treated with the immunomodulatory agents described have a less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they are deemed some protection from their immunomodulatory treatment, or if they develop infections similar to non-immunocompromised patients. There is a huge unmet clinical need to advise patients responsibly about whether they should remain on their immunomodulatory treatment or not in light of Covid-19 infection. In this article we will discuss potential treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 using immunomodulatory drugs and at what stage of the condition they may be beneficial. Viable treatment options during the global coronavirus pandemic are a much-needed and an intensely active area of research.","Burrage, Daniel R; Koushesh, Soraya; Sofat, Nidhi",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01844,32903555,"Musculoskeletal Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Rheumatology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Musculoskeletal Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom.; Musculoskeletal Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Rheumatology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32903555,

This outbreak immediately affected gastroenterologists as well as global physicians worldwide because COVID-19 can be associated with not only triggering respiratory inflammation but also gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation based on the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via its receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed on GI cells. However, the comorbidity spectrum of digestive system in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Because the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with immune-based therapies, physicians, and patients have great concern about whether IBD patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worsened disease courses.","Nakase, Hiroshi; Matsumoto, Takayuki; Matsuura, Minoru; Iijima, Hideki; Matsuoka, Katsuyoshi; Ohmiya, Naoki; Ishihara, Shunji; Hirai, Fumihito; Wagatsuma, Kouhei; Yokoyama, Yoshihiro; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu",Digestion,1421-9867,10.1159/000510502,32892197,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan, hiro_nakase@sapmed.ac.jp.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Toho University Sakura Medical Center, Chiba, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Medicine, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32892197,

Often delivered through food, dietary products, supplements, and drugs, different legislations for safety and efficacy issues have been prepared. Furthermore, regulatory agencies have addressed various approaches toward these products, whether they authorize claims mentioning a disease's diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. Due to the diversity of bacteria and yeast strains, strict approaches have been designed to assess for side effects and post-market surveillance. One of the most essential delivery systems of probiotics is within food, due to the great beneficial health effects of this system compared to pharmaceutical products and also due to the increasing importance of food and nutrition. Modern lifestyle or various diseases lead to an imbalance of the intestinal flora. Nonetheless, as the amount of probiotic use needs accurate calculations, different factors should also be taken into consideration.

Corona Virus Disease-19 pandemic: The gastroenterologists' perspective.,Jun 2020,"The world is witnessing a serious public health threat in the wake of the third corona virus pandemic, a novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]). The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is not limited to the respiratory system but has widespread involvement including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver, with evidence of prolonged fecal shedding and feco-oral transmission. This finding has stirred up a hornet's nest of not only a newer modality of the spread of the virus but also a risk of the unpredictable duration of the infective potential of the shedders. We reviewed the literature on fecal shedding and possible implications on prevention and surveillance strategies. The pandemic is changing the management of underlying chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other diseases. Moreover, for the gastroenterologist, doing endoscopic procedures in this COVID-19 era poses a high risk of contamination, as it is an aerosol-generating procedure. There is a daily influx of data on this disease, and multiple societies are coming up with various recommendations.

IBD Patients Could Be Silent Carriers for Novel Coronavirus and Less Prone to its Severe Adverse Events: True or False?,Jul 2020,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The goal of IBD treatment is to reduce the inflammation period and induce long-term remission. Use of anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and biologicals, is often the first step in the treatment of IBD. Therefore, IBD patients in pandemic of infectious diseases are considered a high-risk group. The public believes that IBD patients are at a higher risk in the current coronavirus 2 pandemic. Nevertheless, these patients may experience mild or moderate complications compared to healthy people. This might be because of particular anti-TNF-α treatment or any immunosuppressant that IBD patients receive. Moreover, these patients might be silent carrier for the virus.","Baradaran Ghavami, S Haghayegh; Shahrokh, S Habnam; Hossein-Khannazer, Nikoo; Shpichka, Anastasia; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Timashev, Peter; Vosough, Massoud",Cell journal,2228-5806,10.22074/cellj.2020.7603,32779446,"Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Chemistry, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.; Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Chemistry, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.; Department of Regenerative Medicine, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.

Simultaneous circulation of COVID-19 and flu in Italy: Potential combined effects on the risk of death?,Oct 2020,"Based on data updated to 20 May 2020, the total recorded number of patients who died due to COVID-19-related reasons in Italy was 31,851. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have died (including the number of comorbidities) are extremely relevant, especially to define those with a higher risk of mortality. Health authorities recommend influenza (flu) vaccinations in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications, including: people aged ≥65 years, or patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The seasonal flu peak certainly preceded that of the pandemic; however, it would seem clear that the two viruses have been simultaneously circulating in Italy for a while. Hence, after the peak of seasonal flu, influenza-like illness-related (ILI) deaths started to grow again. While some of the excess mortality reported in the ILI group may be attributable to COVID-19, a question arises: do we have to consider this observation as a result of a random sequence of events or a potential relationship between the two viruses play a role? A cooperation mechanism intended at establishing an absolute advantage over the host could also be assumed; this system often takes place to boost the reproductive probabilities. A characterization of those who died due to virus-related reasons can be performed by cross-linking data (stored in different warehouses) from the same geographical area and developing electronic health records. It would be of great relevance to identify people at very high risk of mortality as a result of an overlapping or combination of risk factors that were separately reported in patients who died from COVID-19 or influenza. A description of the subgroup of people at higher risk of mortality will be crucial for prioritizing and implementing future public health prevention and treatment programs.","Capone, Alessandro",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,1878-3511,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.077,32768696,"Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation Group (external member), Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK.

Impact of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic on gastrointestinal disorders.,Jun 2020,"Worldwide, several hospitals in different regions and countries have been affected with Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19). All medical specialties including gastroenterology are impacted by COVID-19. Here, we review the bidirectional comorbidity of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and COVID-19, including the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in individuals with various GI disorders and the impact of COVID-19 on the course and outcome of the underlying (or comorbid) GI disorders. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is more (or less) frequent in comorbid GI disorders. It is also reassuring that the outcome of COVID-19 is unaffected by the underlying GI disorder or its treatment, though potential concerns remain in regard to the use of immunomodulatory treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant recipients. Despite these concerns, there is now agreement among experts that ongoing immunomodulatory treatments may not be interrupted in individuals with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution, however, may be exercised with the use of corticosteroids in the management of IBD. In addition, COVID-19 does not appear to impact the manifestations, course, outcome, and treatment of comorbid GI disorders, e.g. IBD. Decompensation of liver cirrhosis is, however, possible during COVID-19 episodes. A direct concern, however, might relate to the potential transmission of the virus through fecal microbiota transplants.","Baryah, Amol Nanak Singh; Midha, Vandana; Mahajan, Ramit; Sood, Ajit",Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,0975-0711,10.1007/s12664-020-01071-6,32749642,"Department of Medicine, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, 141 001, India.; Department of Medicine, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, 141 001, India.; Department of Gastroenterology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, 141 001, India.; Department of Gastroenterology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, 141 001, India. ajitsood10@gmail.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32749642,
Cell type-specific immune dysregulation in severely ill COVID-19 patients.,Jul 2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become the most serious pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic. In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","Yao, Changfu; Bora, Stephanie A; Parimon, Tanyalak; Zaman, Tanzira; Friedman, Oren A; Palatinus, Joseph A; Surapaneni, Nirmala S; Matusov, Yuri P; Chiang, Giuliana Cerro; Kassar, Alexander G; Patel, Nayan; Green, Chelsi Er; Aziz, Adam W; Suri, Harshpreet; Suda, Jo; Lopez, Andres A; Martins, Gislaine A; Stripp, Barry R; Gharib, Sina A; Goodridge, Helen S; Chen, Peter",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,,10.1101/2020.07.23.20161182,32743611,"Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.; F.

Care of the Patient With IBD Requiring Hospitalisation During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Oct 2020,"The management of IBD has been highly affected in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with restriction of hospitalisations and unprecedented redeployment of health care resources. Hospital admissions of IBD patients should be limited to reduce the risks of coronavirus transmission. However, delaying hospitalisation of IBD patients with severe or complicated disease may increase the risk of poor outcomes. Delaying surgery in some cases may increase the risk of disease progression, postoperative morbidity, and disease complications. IBD patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher risk of poor outcomes than the general population, potentially related to concomitant medications, especially corticosteroids. There is no evidence today that IBD patients with COVID-19 have worse outcomes if they receive immunosuppressant medications including thiopurines, biologics, and novel small molecules. This article summarises recommendations by the international membership of IOIBD regarding hospitalisations of IBD patients, either for active or complicated IBD or for severe COVID-19, and for management of IBD patients according to SARS-CoV-2 infectious status.","Allez, Matthieu; Fleshner, Phillip; Gearry, Richard; Lakatos, Peter L; Rubin, David T",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa150,32722757,"Hôpital Saint-Louis, Department of Gastroenterology, APHP, Université de Paris, France.; Division of Colorectal Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.; McGill University, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Montreal, QC, Canada and Semmelweis University, 1st Department of Medicine, Budapest, Hungary.; University of Chicago Medicine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Chicago, IL, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722757,
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Management During the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Ten Do's and Don'ts from the ECCO-COVID Taskforce.,Oct 2020,"Our knowledge of COVID-19 is changing and evolving rapidly, with novel insights and recommendations, almost on a daily basis. It behooves the medical community to provide updated information on a regular basis, on best practice to facilitate optimal care of infected patients and on appropriate advice for the general population. This is particularly important in the case of patients with chronic conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. In this review, we have compiled existing evidence on the impact of COVID-19 in IBD patients and provide guidance on the most appropriate care to adopt during the pandemic. Our review highlights that IBD, per se, is not a risk factor for COVID-19. However, all IBD patients with symptoms should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the procedures for disease management should be carefully adapted: [i] in SARS-CoV-2-positive IBD patients, medical treatments should be re-evaluated [with a particular focus on corticosteroids] always with the purpose of treating active disease and maintaining remission; [ii] non-urgent surgeries and endoscopic procedures should be postponed for all patients; [iii] online consultancy should be implemented; and [iv] hospitalization and surgery should be limited to life-threatening situations.","Magro, F; Rahier, J-F; Abreu, C; MacMahon, E; Hart, A; van der Woude, C J; Gordon, H; Adamina, M; Viget, N; Vavricka, S; Kucharzik, T; Leone, S; Siegmund, B; Danese, S; Peyrin-Biroulet, L",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa160,32722754,"Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Department of Gastroenterology, Centro Hospitalar de São João, Porto, Portugal; Department of Clinical Pharmacology Centro Hospitalar de São João, Porto, Portugal.; CHU UCL Namur, Université catholique de Louvain, service de Hépato-gastroentérologie, Yvoir, Belgium.; Infectious Diseases Service, Centro Hospitalar Universitário São João, Porto, Portugal; Instituto de Inovação e Investigação em Saúde (I3s), Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; IBD Unit, St Mark's Hospital, London, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlnads.; Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UKCentre for Immunobiology, The Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Department of Surgery, Cantonal Hospital Winterthur, Winterthur, Switzerland.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Tourcoing Hospital, Tourcoing, France.; Center for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zürich, Switzerland.; Lüneburg Hospital, University of Hamburg, Department of Gastroenterology, Lüneburg, Germany.; EFCCA, European Federation of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Associations, Brussels, Belgium.; Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health, Medizinische Klinik für Gastroenterologie, Infektiologie und Rheumatologie, Berlin, Germany.; Division of Gastroenterology, IBD Center, Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Gastroenterology, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France.; Inserm NGERE U1256, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722754,

The Thrilling Journey of SARS-CoV-2 into the Intestine: From Pathogenesis to Future Clinical Implications.,Aug 2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has a direct impact on the gastrointestinal system, as up to 50% of fecal samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients contain detectable viral RNA despite a negative rhino-pharyngeal swab. This finding, together with an intestinal expression of angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 protein, suggests a possible fecal-oral transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients including watery diarrhea, vomiting-particularly in children-nausea, and abdominal pain. Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents significant similarities to those of some immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the hypothesis that targeted therapies used for the treatment of immune-mediated disease could be effective to treat (and possibly prevent) the main complications of COVID-19. In this review, we synthesize the present and future impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal system and on gastroenterology practice, hypothesizing a potential role of the ""gut-lung axis"" and perhaps of the gut and lung microbiota into the interindividual differential susceptibility to COVID-19 19 disease. Finally, we speculate on the reorganization of outpatient gastroenterology services, which need to consider, among other factors, the major psychological impact of strict lockdown measures on the whole population.","Scaldaferri, Franco; Ianiro, Gianluca; Privitera, Giuseppe; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo; Vetrone, Lorenzo Maria; Petito, Valentina; Pugliese, Daniela; Neri, Matteo; Cammarota, Giovanni; Ringel, Yehuda; Costamagna, Guido; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Boskoski, Ivo; Armuzzi, Alessandro",Inflammatory bowel diseases,1536-4844,10.1093/ibd/izaa181,32720978,"CEMAD, IBD UNIT - Unità Operativa Complessa di Medicina Interna e Gastroenterologia, Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

Immunological co-ordination between gut and lungs in SARS-CoV-2 infection.,Sep 2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a major pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has created unprecedented global health emergencies, and emerged as a serious threat due to its strong ability for human-to-human transmission. The reports indicate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to affect almost any organ due to the presence of a receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) across the body. ACE2 receptor is majorly expressed in the brush border of gut enterocytes along with the ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells in the lungs. The amino acid transport function of ACE2 has been linked to gut microbial ecology in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby suggesting that COVID-19 may, to some level, be linked to the enteric microbiota. The significant number of COVID-19 patients shows extra-pulmonary symptoms in the GI tract. Many subsequent studies revealed viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples of COVID-19 patients. This presents a new challenge in the diagnosis and control of COVID-19 infection with a caution for proper sanitation and hygiene. Here, we aim to discuss the immunological co-ordination between gut and lungs that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 to infect and multiply in the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-IBD patients.","Ahlawat, Shruti; Asha,; Sharma, Krishna Kant",Virus research,1872-7492,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198103,32717345,"Laboratory of Enzymology and Recombinant DNA Technology, Department of Microbiology, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, 124001, Haryana, India.; Laboratory of Enzymology and Recombinant DNA Technology, Department of Microbiology, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, 124001, Haryana, India.; Laboratory of Enzymology and Recombinant DNA Technology, Department of Microbiology, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, 124001, Haryana, India.

Protective Effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) in Diseases with Uncontrolled Immune Activation: Could Such a Scenario Be Helpful to Counteract COVID-19?,Jul 2020,"Some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop acute pneumonia which can result in a cytokine storm syndrome in response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The most effective anti-inflammatory drugs employed so far in severe COVID-19 belong to the cytokine-directed biological agents, widely used in the management of many autoimmune diseases. In this paper we analyze the efficacy of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea leaves and a well-known antioxidant, in counteracting autoimmune diseases, which are dominated by a massive cytokines production. Indeed, many studies registered that EGCG inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription factors, whose activities are crucial in a multiplicity of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Importantly, the safety of EGCG/green tea extract supplementation is well documented in many clinical trials, as discussed in this review. Since EGCG can restore the natural immunological homeostasis in many different autoimmune diseases, we propose here a supplementation therapy with EGCG in COVID-19 patients. Besides some antiviral and anti-sepsis actions, the major EGCG benefits lie in its anti-fibrotic effect and in the ability to simultaneously downregulate expression and signaling of many inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, EGCG can be considered a potential safe natural supplement to counteract hyper-inflammation growing in COVID-19.","Menegazzi, Marta; Campagnari, Rachele; Bertoldi, Mariarita; Crupi, Rosalia; Di Paola, Rosanna; Cuzzocrea, Salvatore",International journal of molecular sciences,1422-0067,10.3390/ijms21145171,32708322,"Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Biochemistry Section, School of Medicine, University of Verona, Strada Le Grazie 8, I-37134 Verona, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Biochemistry Section, School of Medicine, University of Verona, Strada Le Grazie 8, I-37134 Verona, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Biochemistry Section, School of Medicine, University of Verona, Strada Le Grazie 8, I-37134 Verona, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Science, University of Messina, Polo Universitario dell'Annunziata, I-98168 Messina, Italy.; Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres 31, I-98166 Messina, Italy.; Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Viale Ferdinando Stagno D'Alcontres 31, I-98166 Messina, Italy.; Department of Pharmacological and Physiological Science, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63104, USA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32708322,

"""Small"" Intestinal Immunopathology Plays a ""Big"" Role in Lethal Cytokine Release Syndrome, and Its Modulation by Interferon-γ, IL-17A, and a Janus Kinase Inhibitor.",2020,"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy, administration of certain T cell-agonistic antibodies, immune check point inhibitors, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by streptococcal as well as staphylococcal superantigens share one common complication, that is T cell-driven cytokine release syndrome (CRS) accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). It is not understood whether the failure of a particular organ contributes more significantly to the severity of CRS. Also not known is whether a specific cytokine or signaling pathway plays a more pathogenic role in precipitating MOD compared to others. As a result, there is no specific treatment available to date for CRS, and it is managed only symptomatically to support the deteriorating organ functions and maintain the blood pressure. Therefore, we used the superantigen-induced CRS model in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice, that closely mimics human CRS, to delineate the immunopathogenesis of CRS as well as to validate a novel treatment for CRS. Using this model, we demonstrate that (i) CRS is characterized by a rapid rise in systemic levels of several Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 type cytokines within a few hours, followed by a quick decline. (ii) Even though multiple organs are affected, small intestinal immunopathology is the major contributor to mortality in CRS. (iii) IFN-γ deficiency significantly protected from lethal CRS by attenuating small bowel pathology, whereas IL-17A deficiency significantly increased mortality by augmenting small bowel pathology. (iv) RNA sequencing of small intestinal tissues indicated that IFN-γ-STAT1-driven inflammatory pathways combined with enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic molecules as well as extracellular matrix degradation contributed to small bowel pathology in CRS. These pathways were further enhanced by IL-17A deficiency and significantly down-regulated in mice lacking IFN-γ. (v) Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK-1/2 inhibitor, attenuated SAg-induced T cell activation, cytokine production, and small bowel pathology, thereby completely protecting from lethal CRS in both WT and IL-17A deficient HLA-DR3 mice. Overall, IFN-γ-JAK-STAT-driven pathways contribute to lethal small intestinal immunopathology in T cell-driven CRS.","Kale, Shiv D; Mehrkens, Brittney N; Stegman, Molly M; Kastelberg, Bridget; Carnes, Henry; McNeill, Rachel J; Rizzo, Amy; Karyala, Saikumar V; Coutermarsh-Ott, Sheryl; Fretz, Jackie A; Sun, Ying; Koff, Jonathan L; Rajagopalan, Govindarajan",Frontiers in immunology,1664-3224,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01311,32676080,"Fralin Life Sciences Institute, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; The Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, Edward via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; College of Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Fralin Life Sciences Institute, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; The Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, Edward via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Research and Graduate Studies, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Office of the University Veterinarian, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Genomics Sequencing Center, Fralin Life Sciences Institute, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Histology and Histomorphometry Laboratory, Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.; Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.; Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.; The Discipline of Microbiology and Immunology, Edward via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.; Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32676080,

Ultraviolet A light effectively reduces bacteria and viruses including coronavirus.,2020,"Antimicrobial-resistant and novel pathogens continue to emerge, outpacing efforts to contain and treat them. Therefore, there is a crucial need for safe and effective therapies. Ultraviolet-A (UVA) phototherapy is FDA-approved for several dermatological diseases but not for internal applications. We investigated UVA effects on human cells in vitro, mouse colonic tissue in vivo, and UVA efficacy against bacteria, yeast, coxsackievirus group B and coronavirus-229E. Several pathogens and virally transfected human cells were exposed to a series of specific UVA exposure regimens. HeLa, alveolar and primary human tracheal epithelial cell viability was assessed after UVA exposure, and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine was measured as an oxidative DNA damage marker. Furthermore, wild-type mice were exposed to intracolonic UVA as an in vivo model to assess safety of internal UVA exposure. Controlled UVA exposure yielded significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridioides difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. UVA-treated coxsackievirus-transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly increased cell survival compared to controls. UVA-treated coronavirus-229E-transfected tracheal cells exhibited significant coronavirus spike protein reduction, increased mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein and decreased coronavirus-229E-induced cell death. Specific controlled UVA exposure had no significant effect on growth or 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in three types of human cells. Single or repeated in vivo intraluminal UVA exposure produced no discernible endoscopic, histologic or dysplastic changes in mice. These findings suggest that, under specific conditions, UVA reduces various pathogens including coronavirus-229E, and may provide a safe and effective treatment for infectious diseases of internal viscera. Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of UVA in humans.","Rezaie, Ali; Leite, Gabriela G S; Melmed, Gil Y; Mathur, Ruchi; Villanueva-Millan, Maria Jesus; Parodi, Gonzalo; Sin, Jon; Germano, Juliana F; Morales, Walter; Weitsman, Stacy; Kim, Seung Young; Park, Jae Ho; Sakhaie, Siamak; Pimentel, Mark",PloS one,1932-6203,10.1371/journal.pone.0236199,32673355,"Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Inflammatory Bowel and Immunobiology Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, South Korea.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, South Korea.; Australian Clinical Labs, Melbourne, Australia.; Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32673355,
Gastrointestinal manifestations and nutritional therapy during COVID-19 pandemic: a practical guide for pediatricians.,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally in pandemic proportions. Accumulative evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the digestive system, the so-called fecal-oral route of transmission, and may induce several gastrointestinal manifestations. MEDLINE® and Embase databases were extensively searched for major clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement in children and adolescents with COVID-19 reported in medical literature, and for nutritional therapy-related data. Findings and recommendations were pragmatically described to facilitate overall pediatric approach. A total of 196 studies addressing gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic were found. Of these, only 17 focused specifically on pediatric patients with regard to aforementioned gastrointestinal or nutritional aspects. Most articles were descriptive and six addressed guidelines, established protocols, or expert opinions. Children and adolescents with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, should be seriously suspected of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may occur in 3% to 79% of children, adolescents and adults with COVID-19, and are more common in severe cases. These include diarrhea (2% to 50%), anorexia (40% to 50%), vomiting (4% to 67%), nausea (1% to 30%), abdominal pain (2% to 6%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (4% to 14%). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic liver disease are not at greater risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 relative to the general population. Nutritional support plays an important role in treatment of pediatric patients, particularly those with severe or critical forms of the disease. The digestive system may be a potential route of COVID-19 transmission. Further research is needed to determine whether the fecal-oral route may be involved in viral spread. Nutritional therapy is vital to prevent malnutrition and sarcopenia in severe cases.","Oba, Jane; Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Silva, Clovis Artur; Delgado, Artur Figueiredo","Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2317-6385,10.31744/einstein_journal/2020rw5774,32667418,"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32667418,

Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Gastroenterologist's Perspective in May 2020.,Jun 2020,"We are in the middle of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which has affected every aspect of human life all over the world. Although COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, it is in fact a multisystem disorder causing high mortality and panicking the whole world. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of this disorder usually accompany respiratory manifestations and this combination is indicative of the severity of the disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, which causes COVID-19, enters the body by attaching to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors which are not only present in the respiratory tract but also in the GI tract. Person-to-person droplet transmission is the main mode of spread although there is potential for fecal-oral transmission. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at increased risk of developing COVID-19 and they should continue to take their current medications. If they become positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or COVID-19, their biologic therapy should be either delayed or on hold temporarily. GI endoscopy units are high-risk areas and GI procedures are high-risk procedures for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only emergency and semi-emergency procedures should be done, and elective procedures should be temporarily on hold until adequate resources are available. Endoscopists should use appropriate personal protective equipment. Mildly abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are common in COVID-19 patients and are mostly due to systemic inflammatory response, hepatic ischemia or hepatotoxic medications. Close monitoring of liver function and supportive care of COVID-19 patients are recommended.","Ahmed, Monjur",Gastroenterology research,1918-2805,10.14740/gr1292,32655724,"Thomas Jefferson University, 132 South 10th Street, Suite 468, Main Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

COVID-19 - more than respiratory disease: a gastroenterologist's perspective.,Apr 2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) outbreak is the most dramatic event since World War II. Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia, it turned out that this viral disease termed COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection, but a systemic disease associated with a number of extrapulmonary complications. One of the medical disciplines that is strongly affected by this viral infection is gastroenterology. COVID-19 causes in some patients typical symptoms of enteritis such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. There is also evidence that this infection may lead to liver and pancreatic injury. Since the SARS-CoV2 virus was detected in stool, a fecal-oral route of transmission is possible. Moreover, viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and enables the invasion of the gastrointestinal epithelium as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the daily practice and the workflows in endoscopy leading to a dramatic decrease of screening and surveillance procedures. COVID-19 impacts the therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those using high doses of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics. Patients with preexisting liver disease, especially metabolic associated liver fatty disease (MALFD) with fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, are at high risk for severe COVID-19. As long as no active vaccine against SARS-CoV2 is available, gastroenterologists have to be aware of these problems that affect their daily routine practice.","Konturek, P C; Harsch, I A; Neurath, M F; Zopf, Y",Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,1899-1505,10.26402/jpp.2020.2.02,32633236,"Department of Internal Medicine II, Thuringia-Clinic Saalfeld, Teaching Hospital of the University of Jena, Germany. pkonturek@web.de.; Department of Internal Medicine II, Thuringia-Clinic Saalfeld, Teaching Hospital of the University of Jena, Germany.; Department of Medicine 1, Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.; Department of Medicine 1, Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32633236,

Putative Roles for Peptidylarginine Deiminases in COVID-19.,Jun 2020,"Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a family of calcium-regulated enzymes that are phylogenetically conserved and cause post-translational deimination/citrullination, contributing to protein moonlighting in health and disease. PADs are implicated in a range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, in the regulation of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, and their roles in infection and immunomodulation are known to some extent, including in viral infections. In the current study we describe putative roles for PADs in COVID-19, based on in silico analysis of BioProject transcriptome data (PRJNA615032 BioProject), including lung biopsies from healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, as well as SARS-CoV-2-infected, and mock human bronchial epithelial NHBE and adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cell lines. In addition, BioProject Data PRJNA631753, analysing patients tissue biopsy data (n = 5), was utilised. We report a high individual variation observed for all PADI isozymes in the patients' tissue biopsies, including lung, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA showed most variability in lung tissue specifically. The other tissues assessed were heart, kidney, marrow, bowel, jejunum, skin and fat, which all varied with respect to mRNA levels for the different PADI isozymes. In vitro lung epithelial and adenocarcinoma alveolar cell models revealed that PADI1, PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA levels were elevated, but PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA levels were reduced in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cells. In A549 cells, PADI2 mRNA was elevated, PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA was downregulated, and no effect was observed on the PADI4 or PADI6 mRNA levels in infected cells, compared with control mock cells. Our findings indicate a link between PADI expression changes, including modulation of PADI2 and PADI4, particularly in lung tissue, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Clinical Trials [and Tribulations]: The Immediate Effects of COVID-19 on IBD Clinical Research Activity in the UK.,Dec 2020,"There have been immediate and profound impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on health care services worldwide, with major consequences for non COVID-19 related health care. Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes, and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care-with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies-which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in IBD. In this Viewpoint, we share our experiences from a clinical and academic perspective in the UK, highlighting the early challenges encountered, and consider implications for patients and staff at research sites, sponsors, research ethics committees, funders, and regulators. We also offer potential solutions both for now and for when we enter a recovery phase from the pandemic.","Noor, Nurulamin M; Hart, Ailsa L; Irving, Peter M; Ghosh, Subrata; Parkes, Miles; Raine, Tim",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa137,32598438,"Department of Gastroenterology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, London, UK.; St Mark's Hospital, IBD Unit, Harrow, London, UK.; IBD Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, UK.; Institute of Translational Medicine, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32598438,
"Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: manifestations, pathology, management and challenges.",2020,"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed as a tremendous threat to global health. Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance. In this review, we summarise recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of faecal-oral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19 and the diagnosis, management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during GI endoscopy procedures.","Su, Song; Shen, Jun; Zhu, Liangru; Qiu, Yun; He, Jin-Shen; Tan, Jin-Yu; Iacucci, Marietta; Ng, Siew C; Ghosh, Subrata; Mao, Ren; Liang, Jie",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,1756-283X,10.1177/1756284820934626,32595762,"State key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease, Shanghai Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Center, Shanghai, China.; Division of Gastroenterology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, NIHR Biomedical Research Institute, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.; Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Institute of Digestive Disease, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, LKS Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, NIHR Biomedical Research Institute, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 58 Zhongshan Road 2, Guangzhou, 510080, P.R.

Managing immunosuppressive drugs in liver transplant and inflammatory bowel disease is a major challenge without clear guidelines. Only emergency endoscopy is to be done with personal protection equipment. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine has shown some beneficial effects and is being used off-label.

Aspects of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic and general considerations.,2020,"So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.","de León-Rendón, J L; Hurtado-Salazar, C; Yamamoto-Furusho, J K",Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico (English),2255-534X,10.1016/j.rgmx.2020.05.001,32536480,"Clínica de Enfermedad Inflamatoria Intestinal, Departamento de Gastroenterología, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Ciudad de México, México.; Clínica de Enfermedad Inflamatoria Intestinal, Departamento de Gastroenterología, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Ciudad de México, México.; Clínica de Enfermedad Inflamatoria Intestinal, Departamento de Gastroenterología, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Ciudad de México, México.

However, clinical trials offer patients who have failed multiple drugs access to study medications with alternative modes of action and the potential for relief from inflammation-mediated symptoms. Therefore, the continuation of clinical trials in IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic is important both for participants and for the community of IBD patients, due to the dire need for an expanded therapeutic armamentarium.

[The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic – practical advices: (A COVID–19-pandémia orvosszakmai kérdései)].,Jun 2020,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are more susceptible to severe viral infections requiring hospitalization regardless of treatment. Immunosuppressives and biological treatments multiply the chances of opportunistic and lung infections, especially in combination therapy, so due to the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) epidemic, which primarily causes respiratory disease, it is advisable to use different therapeutic considerations for effective and safe patient care. Contrary to the expectations, a study from Italy and China each, despite of the large number of infected cases, did not report any SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which can be due to a number of favorable factors, such as the lower average age of the patients, lack of comorbidities, etc. However, it should not be forgotten that the patients on immunosuppressive and/or biological therapy belong to the compromised group. Consequently, in some cases there is a need to modify the therapy, but we should keep in mind that the relapse alongside with the need of medical consultation and even hospitalization elevate the chance of being infected. Thus, flare-ups ought to be avoided as far as they can be, so continuing the already started maintenance therapy can be a reasonable solution, but, in the high-risk group, modifying it can be reasonable as well. Our aim with this article is to make the health care more effective, and to give a practical recommendation for physicians during the epidemic, based on international publications.

Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working Party guidelines on IBD management during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Jun 2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, secondary to SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in high mortality and morbidity worldwide. As inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease, and most patients are on long-term immunosuppressive agents, there is understandable concern, particularly in terms of therapy. In view of this, experts in IBD across the Asia Pacific region were invited to put together recommendations based on their experience and the currently available data. In general, most IBD therapies (with a few exceptions) can be continued safely, and the general consensus is that maintaining disease control should remain the main principle of management. In addition, social distancing measures and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment should be strictly adhered to. During the current pandemic, face-to-face clinic follow ups and non-urgent procedures should be kept to a minimum.","Ling, Khoon Lin; Hilmi, Ida; Raja Ali, Raja Affendi; Leong, Rupert W L; Leung, Wai Keung; Ng, Siew Chien; Wu, Kai Chun; Chen, Min Hu; Ran, Zhi Hua; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu; Ahuja, Vineet; Makharia, Govind K; Banerjee, Rupa; Wei, Shu Chen; Wu, Deng Chyang; Pisespongsa, Pises; Ye, Byong Duk; Sollano, Jose; Simadibrata, Marcellus; Chuah, Sai Wei; Ooi, Choon Jin",JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2397-9070,10.1002/jgh3.12362,32514431,Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre Singapore.; Duke-NUS Medical School Singapore.; University of Malaya Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.; The National University of Malaysia Bangi Malaysia.; Concord Hospital Sydney New South Wales Australia.; University of Hong Kong Hong Kong.; The Chinese University of Hong Kong Hong Kong.; Fourth Military Medical University Xi'an China.; Sun Yat-Sen University Guangzhou China.; Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China.; Kyorin University School of Medicine Mitaka Japan.; All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi India.; All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi India.; Asian Institute of Gastroenterology Hyderabad India.; National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine Taipei Taiwan.; Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital Kaohsiung Taiwan.; Bumrungrad International Hospital Bangkok Thailand.; University of Ulsan College of Medicine Seoul South Korea.; University of Santo Tomas Manila Philippines.; Universitas Indonesia Jakarta Indonesia.; Gleneagles Medical Centre Singapore.; Duke-NUS Medical School Singapore.; Gleneagles Medical Centre Singapore.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514431,

Implications of COVID-19 for the busy gastroenterologist.,Mar 2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originated in China in December 2020 and declared pandemic by WHO. This coronavirus mainly spreads through the respiratory tract and enters cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, and fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, anorexia, and vomiting) may be present in 50% of patients and may be associated with worst prognosis. Other risk factors are older age, male gender, and underlying chronic diseases. Mitigation measures are essential to reduce the number of people infected. Hospitals are a place of increased SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This has implications in the organization of healthcare services and specifically endoscopy departments. Patients and healthcare workers safety must be optimized in this new reality. Comprehension of COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations and implications of SARS-CoV-2 in the management of patients with gastrointestinal diseases, under or not immunosuppressant therapies, is essential. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress and major societies recommendations regarding the implications of COVID-19 in gastroenterology, namely the adaptations that gastroenterology/endoscopy departments and professionals must do in order to optimize the provided assistance, as well as the implications that this infection will have, in particularly vulnerable patients such as those with chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease under or not immunosuppressant therapies.","Ferreira-Silva, Joel; Peixoto, Armando; Rodrigues-Pinto, Eduardo; Macedo, Guilherme",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,1473-5687,10.1097/MEG.0000000000001811,32501876,"Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar de São João.; Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar de São João.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar de São João.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar de São João.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32501876,

An evaluation of mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19.,Jun 2020,"Mathematical modelling performs a vital part in estimating and controlling the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.","Wang, Ning; Fu, Yuting; Zhang, Hu; Shi, Huipeng",Precision clinical medicine,2516-1571,10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa016,35960670,"Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK.; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, UK.; Department of Gastroenterology & Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai 6th People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 201306, China.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35960670,

Pediatric Crohn Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and COVID-19 Treated With Infliximab.,Aug 2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to a severe inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm. We describe a case of severe COVID-19 infection in a recently diagnosed pediatric Crohn disease patient successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade. The patient presented with 5 days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet. Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease or severe COVID-19 alone. The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-α blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19. Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension resolved. Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations. This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade. The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.","Dolinger, Michael T; Person, Hannibal; Smith, Rachel; Jarchin, Lauren; Pittman, Nanci; Dubinsky, Marla C; Lai, Joanne",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,1536-4801,10.1097/MPG.0000000000002809,32452979,"Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Clinical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32452979,

Temporal Correlation Between Neurological and Gastrointestinal Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2.,Jul 2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2) has been shown to invade brain tissue. Based on the evolutionary similarity with SARS-CoV, researchers propose that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal (GI) system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear. Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case. The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms. COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain. The temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the GI tract, the vascular system, or the gut-brain axis (enteric nervous system) as the most likely entry route for SARS-CoV-2 to the brain.","Bostancıklıoğlu, Mehmet",Inflammatory bowel diseases,1536-4844,10.1093/ibd/izaa131,32440692,"Elysium Health Center, Gaziantep, Turkey.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32440692,

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the daily management of biotechnological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease patients: Reorganisational response in a high-volume Italian inflammatory bowel disease centre.,Aug 2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major clinical as well as organisational impact on the national health-care system in Italy, particularly in high-volume hospitals which are usually active for many essential clinical needs, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government's restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All routine follow-up IBD visits of patients in remission were cancelled or rescheduled for 8-12 weeks' time. However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable. Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves. At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning. A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study. About 65% of patients maintained their appointment schedules without major problems, while in 20% of cases planned infusions were delayed because of the patient's decision or practical issues. About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit. Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home. At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection. Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms. This study represents the first observational detailed report about short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient organisation and management in a high-volume IBD centre.","Scaldaferri, Franco; Pugliese, Daniela; Privitera, Giuseppe; Onali, Sara; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo; Rizzatti, Gianenrico; Settanni, Carlo Romano; Pizzoferrato, Marco; Schiavoni, Elisa; Turchini, Laura; Amatucci, Valeria; Napolitano, Daniele; Bernabei, Tiziana; Mora, Vincenzina; Laterza, Lucrezia; Papa, Alfredo; Guidi, Luisa; Rapaccini, Gian Lodovico; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Armuzzi, Alessandro",United European gastroenterology journal,2050-6414,10.1177/2050640620929133,32438878,"CEMAD - IBD UNIT - Unitá Operativa Complessa di Medicina Interna e Gastroenterologia, c Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis. The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high. The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection. Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19.

Clinical course of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in individuals present during the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.,Aug 2020,"We investigated the clinical course of individuals with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who were transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to 12 local hospitals. The conditions and clinical courses of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of patients without pneumonia. Among 70 patients (median age: 67 years) analyzed, the major symptoms were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). Forty-three patients (61.4%) had pneumonia. Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%). Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died. The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring. The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia. High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are invited to follow the national recommendations as any other person. It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension. However, during pandemic, the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics should be postponed whenever possible and based on an individual risk assessment. When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion. Serum antibody testing, when available, could provide evidence of infection as well as identify patients already immune to the disease.","Zingone, Fabiana; Buda, Andrea; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,1878-3562,10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.004,32360133,"Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Italy.; Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Gastrointestinal Oncological Surgery, S.Maria del Prato Hospital, Feltre, Italy.; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Italy.

Addressing multiple gastroenterological aspects of coronavirus disease 2019.,May 2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic has become the biggest challenge for the whole human community since many years. It seems that the proper identification of all people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the best strategy to limit the transmission. However, in a significant proportion of patients, there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, and symptoms may be very mild or atypical. There is a growing body of evidence that digestive manifestations of COVID‑19 are frequently reported and may precede typical respiratory symptoms. Moreover, SARS‑CoV‑2 particles were found in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and viral RNA was detected in the feces of patients with COVID‑19. These data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID‑19 are not accidental findings and they may result from direct digestive involvement. Patients with new‑onset diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any other evident etiological factors should be tested for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. Gastroenterologists and members of other medical specialties should also remember that the current epidemiological situation has changed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in the management of several gastrointestinal and liver disorders. This review article summarizes the currently available data on multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID‑19 and provides information on practical recommendations and position statements of the most prominent associations in the field of gastroenterology, which appeared in response to the emergence of the pandemic.","Eder, Piotr; Łodyga, Michał; Dobrowolska, Agnieszka; Rydzewska, Grażyna; Kamhieh-Milz, Julian",Polish archives of internal medicine,1897-9483,10.20452/pamw.15332,32356641,"Department of Gastroenterology, Dietetics and Internal Medicine, Poznań University of Medical Sciences, Heliodor Święcicki University Hospital, Poznań, Poland. piotr.eder@op.pl; Department of Gastroenterology with the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Subdivision, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration,

COVID-19 and immunomodulation in IBD.,Jul 2020,"The current coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis due to COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although COVID-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.","Neurath, Markus F",Gut,1468-3288,10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321269,32303609,"First Department of Medicine and Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie DZI, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen 91052, Germany markus.neurath@uk-erlangen.de.; Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32303609,

This is a novel coronavirus; much is unknown as to how it will affect people with IBD. We also lack information about the impact of different immunosuppressive medications. To address this uncertainty, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) COVID-19 IBD Working Group has used the best available data and expert opinion to generate a risk grid that groups patients into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories. This grid allows patients to be instructed to follow the UK government's advice for shielding, stringent and standard advice regarding social distancing, respectively.

The daily impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology.,Jun 2020,"A new strain of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, probably originating from a wild-animal contamination. Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently. In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, this pandemic can only be controlled through prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the main objectives of providing patients the best healthcare possible and reduce mortality.","Magro, Fernando; Abreu, Candida; Rahier, Jean-François",United European gastroenterology journal,2050-6414,10.1177/2050640620920157,32281517,"Department of Biomedicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Gastroenterology, Centro Hospitalar São João, Porto, Portugal.; MedInUP, Center for Drug Discovery and Innovative Medicines, Porto, Portugal.; Infectious Diseases Service, Centro Hospitalar São João, Porto, Portugal.; Instituto de Inovação e Investigação em Saúde (I3s), Grupo de I&D em Nefrologia e Doenças Infeciosas, Instituto Nacional de Engenharia Biomédica (INEB), Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Portugal.; Department of Gastroenterology, Université Catholique de Louvain, Yvoir, Belgium *Fernando Magro and Candida Abreu contributed equally to this work.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32281517,

Are Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Increased Risk for Covid-19 Infection?,Sep 2020,"Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], the main inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] in humans, are chronic, immune-inflammatory diseases, the pathogenesis of which suggests a complex interaction between environmental factors and genetic susceptibility. These disabling conditions affect millions of individuals and, together with the drugs used to treat them, can put patients at risk of developing complications and other conditions. This is particularly relevant today, as coronavirus disease [Covid-19] has rapidly spread from China to countries where IBD are more prevalent, and there is convincing evidence that Covid-19-mediated morbidity and mortality are higher in subjects with comorbidities. The primary objectives of this Viewpoint are to provide a focused overview of the factors and mechanisms by which the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infects cells and to illustrate the link between such determinants and intestinal inflammation. We also provide clues about the reasons why the overall IBD population might have no increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of cytokine blockers, used to treat IBD patients, to prevent Covid-driven pneumonia.","Monteleone, Giovanni; Ardizzone, Sandro",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,1876-4479,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa061,32215548,"Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome 'TOR VERGATA', Rome, Italy.; Gastrointestinal Unit, ASST-Fatebenefratelli Sacco - Department of Biochemical and Clinical Sciences 'L.
